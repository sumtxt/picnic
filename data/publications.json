          "authors": "Kristine W. Hankins, Morteza Momeni, David Sovich",
          "abstract": "Captive finance subsidiaries create a channel for trade policy to affect consumer credit. Examining the impact of the Trump administration’s metal tariffs on captive automobile lenders, we find that consumers received higher interest rates from captive lenders after the tariffs relative to unaffected noncaptive lenders. Further, we document a disparate impact on low-income borrowers and in areas with less lending competition. Our results suggest that tariffs may impact not only the price of goods but also the financing terms of purchases. Thus, focusing solely on directly affected product prices may underestimate tariff pass-through significantly. (JEL F13, F14, G21, L22, L61, L62)",

          "abstract": "This paper estimates the effects of improving public transit infrastructure on city structure and welfare. It develops a quantitative urban model with multiple worker groups and transit modes, and derives a special case yielding sufficient statistics for aggregate welfare in a broad class of models. The paper estimates reduced-form elasticities to implement the approach using data spanning construction of the world’s largest Bus Rapid Transit system in Bogotá, Colombia. This class of models explains observed adjustments in economic activity. Standard value-of-time calculations capture only 52 percent of welfare gains. Accounting for reallocation and general equilibrium effects, distributional impacts are modest. (JEL H76, L92, L98, O18, R42, R53)",

          "abstract": "We argue that consumer credit spreads matter for household choices and that time-varying spreads have important distributional consequences. Studying Danish household data, we show that consumer credit spreads have heterogeneous impact on asset dynamics and consumption choices across the wealth distribution and that time-varying spreads induce a countercyclical marginal propensity to consume. We study a HANK model where banks provide consumer credit and corporate loans. Through countercyclical credit spreads, frictional finance amplifies aggregate shocks and induces consumption inequality. Economies with less leveraged banks experience reduced aggregate volatility but may face higher volatility and lower welfare at the household level. (JEL D12, D31, E12, E21, E32, E52, G51)",

Leveraging a discontinuous regulation that mandates agencies to publicize certain contract opportunities, we document that expanding the set of bidders reduces award prices but deteriorates post-award performance in terms of cost overruns and delays. We develop and estimate an auction model with endogenous entry and stochastic execution performance, in which the buyer endogenously chooses the intensity of competition. Model estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in performance across contractors and show that simple adjustments to the current regulation could provide significant savings in procurement spending.

Using data on 29,809 management-track employees from a large retail chain, we find that women receive substantially lower potential ratings despite receiving higher performance ratings. Differences in potential ratings account for approximately half of the gender promotion gap. Women’s lower potential ratings do not reflect accurate forecasts of future performance: Women subsequently outperform male colleagues, both on average and on the margin of promotion. We highlight two mechanisms driving the gender potential gap: strategic retention and stereotyping. (JEL J16, J31, J71, L81, M12, M51)",

For all US office markets combined, we find a $556.8 billion value destruction.

Interruptions that are negative in tenor or tone or cut off the presenter mid-sentence increase for women presenters. We also find greater engagement of female audience members with female presenters, suggesting a potential role model effect. (JEL A11, C45, J16, J44)",

          "abstract": "Principal-agent problems often extend beyond what can be directly addressed through conventional incentive arrangements. We examine a context where physicians are likely under-incentivized to minimize total medical costs until their private financial interests align with those of patients. Leveraging novel data on physician ownership of ambulatory surgery centers——that is, same-day facilities——we show that these equity holdings cause a substitution away from higher cost, rival settings that lowers Medicare spending by 10–40 percent per physician. We find no clear evidence of perverse behavior following these investments. Instead, our findings demonstrate how entrepreneurial activity can indirectly limit principal-agent problems and improve efficiency. (JEL D82, D91, G51, I11, I18, L84)",

To this end, I develop a dynamic contracting model with limited enforcement in which buyers can default on their trade credit debt and estimate it using a novel dataset from the Ecuadorian manufacturing supply chain. The key empirical finding is that bilateral trade is inefficiently low in early periods of the relationship, but converges toward efficiency over time, despite sellers’ market power. Counterfactual simulations imply that both market power and enforcement contribute to inefficiencies in trade. (JEL D86, G32, K12, L14, L60, O14)",

          "abstract": "Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms’ optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s. (JEL D21, D43, E13, E23, E31, E32)",

          "abstract": "What makes populist parties successful? What is the contribution of populist ideas to their appeal? How do they affect a voter’s choice? In this article, we treat populist orientation as just another dimension of spatial competition alongside economic and cultural dimensions, and assess its influence on vote choice. Using survey data from nine countries, we place voters and parties along the populist, economic, and cultural dimensions and estimate a spatial model of vote choice. We find that voters’ populist orientations are negatively correlated with their pro-market orientation and positively correlated with their cultural conservatism. We also find that proximity along the populist dimension has a tangible, albeit varying, weight in vote choice. This means that populist appeal can pull populist voters toward populist parties (and non-populist voters toward non-populist parties) even if they do not perfectly align with them on economic and cultural dimensions.",

          "abstract": "Collective efficacy—the shared expectation that a community can coordinate around desired outcomes—is critical for understanding development in rural Africa, where villagers often shoulder the brunt of local development initiatives. We argue that distinct modes of state-building generated uneven endowments of collective efficacy in the hinterlands of African states: more interventionist state-building oriented political action upwards towards the state, undermining local collective efficacy. Using original data from the Ghana-Togo borderlands, we show that collective efficacy is systematically higher and collective action more common in rural Ghana, where state-building efforts from the colonial era onward have emphasized local action. In contrast, Togolese have faced a more interventionist state. This relationship is robust to several confounding factors, and we document similar dynamics across the Nigeria-Benin border, as well as sub-nationally within Ghana. Our findings hold important implications for both the current embrace of participatory development and recent scholarship on state-building and historical legacies.",

          "abstract": "The article lays the foundations of a research agenda on the conditions favoring short-term success against emerging illiberal challenges—necessary for democrats to rebuild support and strengthen democratic resilience. When confronting an illiberal executive (resistance scenario) or a rising illiberal opposition (prevention scenario), democrats face a temporal paradox: early in the confrontation, illiberals are easier to defeat, but uncertainty about the regime threat hampers coordination and mobilization. As illiberals gain influence, the threat becomes clearer, improving the chances of effective coordination, yet the range of viable countermeasures shrinks, reducing the likelihood of success. Exogenous information and favorable institutional legacies enhance democrats’ ability to navigate this paradox successfully. When an illiberal opposition is on the brink of power, democrats enter trench warfare (containment scenario), best seen as part of a longer-run sequence. The article identifies key research challenges and summarizes how the contributions to this special issue address some of them.",

I argue that in unstable political conditions, the effects of legibility may be limited to the local level. I analyze the French Napoleonic cadaster, an ambitious land survey designed to rationalize taxation following the 1789 revolution. The initially centralized process was decentralized after the fall of the Napoleonic empire in 1815. Exploiting variation in cadastral operations over forty years of implementation, I show that legibility did not increase fiscal revenue at the aggregate level, and even reduced it in the short run. In the long run, I find positive local effects of the centralized cadaster on fiscal revenue. Legibility also facilitated local public works and shifts in the management of communal land. The cadaster thus failed an instrument of broad fiscal reform but arguably strengthened the state’s reach at the local level.",

While we understand that political elites often incite nationalist violence against ethnic minorities during democratization to retain political power, we know less about when and why this nationalist violence takes on a religious tone? I contend that the prior autocratic regime’s cooptation of the majority religious clergy for legitimacy incentivizes these coopted clergy to incite hatred against a small religious minority during democratization to protect the dominance of a religious national identity. This hate campaign, however, is not motivated by the threat posed by the targeted minority to the religious majority, but rather, the threat posed by mobilized secular co-religionist leaders to the status of demobilized religious clergy in national identity during democratization. I use a mixed-methods approach to demonstrate the plausibility of my argument in the case of Myanmar.",

Using a large collection of national election studies over the last six decades, I find that there is no increase in leader importance over time, but a drop in party relevance in the 1990s followed by a gradual party comeback. I find little support for media affecting this trend. Instead, I find support for the trend aligning with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communist ideology, which left parties with-out a vital cleavage on which to structure electoral competition, the decline of traditional class cleavages, and the subsequent changes in party strategy. My findings suggest that behavioral personalization is much less pronounced, a cautionary interpretation of the role of media, and a larger role for issue politics in voting decisions.",

          "abstract": "Research on the impact of elections on attitudes toward democracy has focused primarily on satisfaction with democracy. Building on this, we analyze how winning and losing elections, along with affective polarization, shapes citizens’ support for norms of democratic restraint and consent. We propose that partisan animus weakens the “reservoir of goodwill” that helps citizens accept democratic norms that may go against their self interest. Using a comparative study of 35 elections and two quasi-experimental case studies, we find that while differences between winners and losers in their support for norms of restraint and consent can be statistically significant, they are substantively small compared to several benchmarks, even in highly polarized contexts. Thus, while satisfaction with democracy is notably shaped by winner-loser dynamics, especially when polarization is high, the impact of those dynamics on support for core democratic principles is limited. These findings improve our understanding of the role of citizens in democratic processes.",

Why do some victories endure while others erode? Drawing on the process-tracing of seventeen movements around mining conflicts in Ecuador and Peru during the 2000s commodity boom, we argue that post-adoption politics are critical. Policy durability requires movements to sustain pressure both from civil society and the state. Beyond sustained mobilization power, durable full gains hinge on two strategic objectives: leveraging a decision point in regulatory agencies and securing a favorable ruling from a higher-level authority such as the presidency or high courts. Movements achieving only the former attain temporary partial gains; lacking both leads to defeat.",

Methods to obtain these estimates require data on the prices that firms charge.

We use an analytical framework to show that trends in markups over time or the dispersion of markups across firms can still be well‐measured with such data. Measuring the average level of the markup does require pricing data, and we propose a consistent estimator for such settings. We validate the analytical results using simulations of a quantitative macroeconomic model and offer supporting evidence from firm‐level administrative production and pricing data. Our analysis supports the use of financial data to measure trends in aggregate markups.",

The hegemon wields this power to demand costly actions out of the targeted entities, including mark‐ups, import restrictions, tariffs, and political concessions. The hegemon uses its power to change targeted entities' activities to manipulate the global equilibrium in its favor and increase its power. A sector is strategic either in helping the hegemon form threats or in manipulating the world equilibrium via input‐output amplification. The hegemon acts a global enforcer, thus adding value to the world economy, but destroys value by distorting the equilibrium in its favor.",

          "abstract": "A multi‐product monopolist faces a buyer who is privately informed about his valuations for the goods. As is well known, optimal mechanisms are in general complicated, while simple mechanisms—such as pure bundling or separate sales—can be far from optimal and do not admit clear‐cut comparisons. We show that this changes if the monopolist has sufficiently precise information about the buyer's valuations: Now, pure bundling always outperforms separate sales; moreover, there is a sense in which pure bundling performs essentially as well as the optimal mechanism. To formalize this, we characterize how fast the corresponding revenues converge to the first‐best revenue as the monopolist's information grows precise: Pure bundling achieves the same convergence rate to the first‐best as optimal mechanisms; in contrast, the convergence rate under separate sales is suboptimal.",

          "abstract": "Weak environmental regulation has global consequences. When domestic regulation fails, the international community can target emitters with trade policy. I develop a dynamic empirical framework for evaluating trade policy as a substitute for domestic regulation, and I apply the framework to the market for palm oil, a major driver of deforestation and global CO 2 emissions. Relative to business as usual, a domestic production tax of 50% reduces CO 2 emissions by 7.4 Gt from 1988 to 2016, amounting to 0.26 Gt annually. Coordinated, committed import tariffs of similar magnitude reduce emissions by 5.4 Gt over the same period. The cost of these import tariffs is only $15 per ton of CO 2 , even accounting for compensating transfers that recognize welfare losses for producing countries. Without coordination and commitment, import tariffs have more limited effects. Alternative policies include domestic export taxes, which are fiscally appealing independent of emission concerns, and a carbon border adjustment mechanism, which encourages domestic regulation.",

          "abstract": "We study the problem of a partisan gerrymanderer who assigns voters to equipopulous districts to maximize his party's expected seat share. The designer faces both aggregate, district‐level uncertainty (how many votes his party will receive) and idiosyncratic, voter‐level uncertainty (which voters will vote for his party). Segregate‐pair districting , where weaker districts contain one type of voter, while stronger districts contain two, is optimal for the gerrymanderer. The optimal form of segregate‐pair districting depends on the designer's popularity and the relative amounts of aggregate and idiosyncratic uncertainty. When idiosyncratic uncertainty dominates, a designer with majority support pairs all voters, while a designer with minority support segregates opposing voters and pairs more favorable voters; these plans resemble uniform districting and “packing‐and‐cracking,” respectively. When aggregate uncertainty dominates, the designer segregates moderate voters and pairs extreme voters; this “matching slices” plan has received some attention in the literature. Estimating the model using precinct‐level returns from recent U.S. House elections shows that, in practice, idiosyncratic uncertainty dominates. We discuss implications for redistricting reform, political polarization, and detecting gerrymandering. Methodologically, we exploit a formal connection between gerrymandering—partitioning voters into districts—and information design—partitioning states of the world into signals.",

Applying this method to a randomized controlled trial on a residential energy rebate program, we find that targeting that optimally exploits both observable data and self‐selection outperforms conventional targeting. We use the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) framework (Imbens and Angrist (1994)) to investigate the mechanism in our approach. By estimating several key LATEs based on the random variation created by our experiment, we demonstrate how our method allows policymakers to identify whose self‐selection would be valuable and harmful to social welfare.",

It uses rich administrative data to study the effects of an Italian reform that raised social security contributions for apprenticeship contracts but granted a substantial discount for firms with 9 employees or less. The discount does not increase demand for apprenticeship contracts. Instead, it subsidizes inframarginal hiring. This reform is not cost-effective. Point estimates imply that each million euros of foregone social security contributions supports the employment of 29 apprentices for one year and no permanent contracts (these estimates are not statistically different from zero).",

Grounded in a humanizing approach and drawing upon the Paris School securitization theory and governmentality, this research explores how security‐driven logics become embedded in institutional practices, shaping migration governance and restricting legal pathways. Through interviews with migration professionals from the Czech Ministry of the Interior, municipalities, integration centres, and NGOs, this study reveals contrasting institutional perspectives. The Ministry of the Interior frames Vietnamese migration as a security risk, linking it to illicit brokerage networks and justifying restrictive policies. Treating integration as secondary, it prioritizes control measures; NGOs and local actors highlight how exclusionary policies push migrants toward informal community structures for support. This dynamic creates a self‐reinforcing cycle of securitization, rooted in the interaction between securitized institutional logics and community dynamics. This study demonstrates how these interactions shape migration governance, reinforce exclusion, and deepen migrant vulnerability.",

Focusing on Turkey's Open Education Faculty (AÖF) in Germany, we combine administrative enrolment records (78,138 student‐year records; 32,155 students) with documentary and media analysis to trace participation, institutional design, and policy framing over four decades (1982–2023). We identify five phases, showing a transformation from economic credentialing oriented toward first‐generation male workers to a predominantly digital platform increasingly used by later‐generation, mostly female learners seeking knowledge tied to culture and identity. Programme choices shifted from economics/business toward theology and sociology. We propose a ‘capability‐mediated engagement’ framework: programme durability depends on adapting to evolving capabilities that members value across life‐course and integration contexts. The findings challenge zero‐sum integration models, suggesting transnational education can complement host‐country belonging.",

          "abstract": "Many countries of the Global North depend on the economic benefits of migration even as their citizens and leaders evince ever more open opposition to immigrants settling and becoming citizens. One result of this misalignment of interests and goals has been the proliferation of visa statuses that commit their bearers to not seeking permanent settlement or citizenship and offer them very few rights. Many scholars have debated whether and in which ways short‐term migration may be normatively problematic, and in particular, exploitative. In this paper we add to existing critiques of temporary migration regimes as unjust and materially exploitative the claim that such schemes exploit not just the labor and other material contributions of short‐term immigrants, but also the social capital they build by necessity when they are in residence.",

          "authors": "Jamie Hintson, Kenneth A. Schultz",
          "abstract": "Scholars and policymakers have argued that territorial revisionism is dangerous because it risks setting off a cascade of claims by states dissatisfied with their borders. This Pandora’s box logic suggests that states that are vulnerable to an unraveling of the status quo have incentives to restrain their territorial ambitions to preserve stability. This paper explores this claim theoretically and empirically. It provides descriptive evidence to determine whether vulnerability to territorial threats has historically been associated with a lower likelihood of initiating territorial disputes. We find some evidence of such an effect in postindependence Africa, where this logic is most frequently invoked, and to some extent in Asia, but not in other regions. To help explain these empirical observations, we develop a multistate model of territorial conflict that identifies the conditions under which cooperation to preserve the territorial status quo can be sustained. The model shows that while an equilibrium of mutual restraint can exist, the necessary conditions are quite restrictive, and this cooperative equilibrium is never unique. Thus while a Pandora’s box of potential claims can provide the basis for a norm of restraint, the emergence of such a norm is neither straightforward nor guaranteed.",

          "authors": "Joshua A. Schwartz, Michael C. Horowitz",
          "abstract": "Are nuclear weapons useful for coercion, and, if so, what factors increase the credibility and effectiveness of nuclear threats? While prominent scholars like Thomas Schelling argue that nuclear brinkmanship, or the manipulation of nuclear risk, can effectively coerce adversaries, others contend nuclear weapons are not effective tools of coercion, especially when designed to achieve offensive and revisionist objectives. Simultaneously, there is broad debate about the incorporation of automation via artificial intelligence into military systems, especially nuclear command and control. We develop a theoretical argument that nuclear threats implemented with automated nuclear launch systems are more credible compared to those implemented via non-automated means. By reducing human control over nuclear use, leaders can more effectively tie their hands and thus signal resolve, even if doing so increases the risk of nuclear war and thus is extremely dangerous. Preregistered survey experiments on an elite sample of United Kingdom Members of Parliament and two public samples of UK citizens provide support for these expectations, showing that in a crisis scenario involving a Russian invasion of Estonia, automated nuclear threats can increase credibility and willingness to back down. From a policy perspective, this paper highlights the dangers of countries adopting automated nuclear systems for malign purposes, and contributes to the literatures on coercive bargaining, weapons of mass destruction, and emerging technology.",

Guided by the theory of dyadic morality, the limited capacity model of motivated-mediated message processing, and exemplification theory, we investigated how safety threats shaped individuals’ physiological responses and behavioral moral decision-making. Using an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment simulating a moral tradeoff, participants crossed a deep pit and made decisions between their safety and that of another person, reflecting a tradeoff between egoism and altruism. Results from an experiment with 201 participants revealed that exposure to threat increased arousal (physiologically and self-reported), which decreased the extent to which they felt their decision harmed others, leading to selfish decisions in the moral dilemma. However, this pattern only manifested when concerns of harm were not made salient before the threatening experience. Together, these findings demonstrate VR’s utility for simulating moral tradeoffs and advancing both psychophysiological and behavioral approaches to media psychology and morality research.",

Second, following Brodeur (2018), we employ a causal identification strategy using quasi-natural randomization in the success or failure of terrorist attacks. We find that a successful terrorist attack has heterogeneous effects on migration sentiments conditional on the political position of the speaker: left-wing speeches become substantially more favorable toward migration after successful attacks, while speeches by right-wing politicians become moderately more negative. Politicians of different ideologies adjusting migration-related sentiment in a direction aligned with their pre-existing partisan positions indicate an increasing polarization among policymakers as a direct consequence of terrorism.",

          "abstract": "Authoritarian regimes rely heavily on informants to infiltrate and surveil dissident organizations. While the role of informants in state repression is well-documented, existing research often overlooks how secret police use the intelligence gathered from informants without compromising their identities. Here, we examine the conditions under which secret police agencies seek to protect informants from exposure. We argue that agencies face a tradeoff between the risks of exposing informants and the costs of implementing protection, often prioritizing protection for informants who are deeply embedded in dissident networks and provide rare, high-value intelligence. Using declassified surveillance reports from 1970s Taiwan, we find that protection is most likely when informants are close to well-connected dissidents, interact with behind-the-scenes activists, or provide sensitive information about internal conflicts. Deeply embedded informants offer high-value intelligence but face greater risks of exposure, making them especially worth protecting. These findings contribute to research on surveillance and repression by showing how secret police manage the risks of informant exposure while leveraging human intelligence to counter dissent.",

          "abstract": "“More than 1 in 8 LGBTQ people live in states where doctors can refuse to treat them.” This headline describes a flurry of laws passed in 2025 allowing doctors to refuse treatment of LGBTQ patients based on personal beliefs. This and other laws like it limit healthcare access and exacerbate health inequality for LGBTQ individuals. But health is not the only domain in which LGBTQ individuals face disparities. Long-standing inequalities also exist in other domains of life, for example, gay men earn up to 32% less wages than their heterosexual peers. In the current research, we ask if exposure to LGBTQ inequality in one domain (e.g., health) motivates more support for action than exposure to inequality in other domains (e.g., economics). In six experiments (five preregistered), we test our hypothesis that emphasizing health-based LGBTQ inequality (vs. economics and belonging) spurs engagement with and support for mitigating action (S1-2). We also investigate why people support action (S1a-1b) and what boosts support (S3a-3c). As predicted and preregistered, we find greater support for action to mitigate health-based LGBTQ inequality, compared to economics and belonging. This occurs, in part, because people blame LGBTQ individuals less for health (vs. economic) disparities and perceive health inequalities to violate morally sacred values, which is associated with greater perceived injustice. Finally, we find that connecting economic inequality to health inequality in individuals’ minds can increase support for mitigating economic inequality.",

While recent work has expanded to explore cross-country behavioral differences, the study of within-country variation has largely focused on gender, ignoring race and ethnicity—so much so that the “W” in WEIRD might as well stand for “White.” Using incentivized tasks and a large, stratified sample of U.S. adults, we document substantial racial and ethnic gaps in competitiveness and risk tolerance both of which are widely studied behavioral measures: (non-Hispanic) Whites are less competitive and more risk tolerant than Blacks and Hispanics. These gaps are comparable in magnitude to the corresponding gender gaps in our sample. Notably, gender differences do not generalize across racial and ethnic groups: Whereas Whites and Hispanics exhibit gender gaps in competitiveness and risk tolerance, Black women neither shy away from competition nor are they less risk tolerant than Black men. These findings challenge prevailing generalizations in the literature and underscore the importance of examining race and ethnicity in behavioral research.",

          "authors": "Moradhvaj Dhakad, Erich Striessnig, Nandita Saikia, Samir K.C., Wolfgang Lutz",
          "abstract": "Preventing premature death is a global policy objective reflected in the SDGs. While numerous studies have found socioeconomic factors to be significantly associated with premature death everywhere in the world, the debate on the relative effect of such factors on mid-age (15 to 59 ages) has not received enough attention, particularly in low-income countries, where this question is pertinent due to scant resources in the healthcare sector. Using nationally representative, longitudinal data from the India Human Development Survey, we assess the relative importance of individual- and community-level education vs. income and wealth in India, where approximately 3 million premature deaths occur annually in mid-ages. We find a clear downward gradient in mid-age mortality with increasing education within each wealth category, whereas no consistent mortality advantage with increasing wealth status is visible within education subgroups. Multilevel logistic regression models show that the decline in the risk of death across the education spectrum by far exceeds (14% for male and 13% for female) the decline moving along the wealth distribution, even after controlling for other relevant demographic, socioeconomic, regional variables. Along with the direct effect of individual-level educational attainment, we also find a protective effect of education at the community level, particularly for women. Based on these findings, we infer that educational attainment is essential for reducing mid-age mortality in India. Population and health policies in developing countries, therefore, should focus on education to prevent adult mortality.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a crucial period for the refinement of neural circuits and cognitive skills. During this time, executive functions mature alongside pronounced structural changes in the brain, including reductions in synapse density. Computational models suggest that synaptic pruning enhances performance by stabilizing neural dynamics—deepening attractor basins and accelerating return to baseline after perturbation. Here, we tested these predictions using EEG data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized controlled trial of foster care as an alternative to institutionalized care. Trial-by-trial EEG residuals during a Flanker task were modeled as a linear dynamical system, and changes in eigenvalue magnitude were tracked across adolescence. Across all groups, eigenvalues decreased with age, consistent with maturation of recurrent computations. However, children with histories of institutional care exhibited consistently higher eigenvalues, suggesting delayed or disrupted refinement of the neural dynamics. Importantly, higher eigenvalues were associated with poorer behavioral performance on the task, linking altered neural dynamics to altered executive functions. These findings demonstrate that early deprivation leaves a lasting imprint on the developmental trajectory of neural dynamics, affecting the maturation of brain systems underlying cognitive control.",

We use archived hair from individuals living along the Wasatch Front in Utah to evaluate changes in exposure to lead over the last 100 y. Current concentrations of lead in hair from this population average almost 100 times lower than before the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency. This low level of lead exposure is likely due to the environmental regulations established by Environmental Protection Agency.",

          "authors": "Xiaomin Wang, Christian Hilbe, Boyu Zhang",
          "abstract": "When people collaborate in groups, they routinely face collective action problems: for the group effort to succeed, individuals need to cooperate despite any incentives to defect. These problems can be modeled with public goods games. To facilitate such an analysis, many studies assume the game is symmetric. Group members have the same means to cooperate (equal endowments), and contributions of different group members are equally effective (equal productivities). Studies that allow for some inequality tend to focus on one kind of inequality only. In practice, however, people can be unequal in many ways. The effect of these inequalities may in turn depend on the specific public goods game considered. To explore these issues, we combine a large-sample experiment with extensive theoretical work. We systematically vary four aspects: the group members’ endowments, their productivities, group size, and whether the public goods game exhibits linear returns or returns given by a threshold function. By exploring all four aspects, we obtain a unique dataset to explore the effect of asymmetry on cooperation. Based on this dataset, we study whether there is an advantage of “aligned inequality”: whether groups achieve a better surplus if more productive individuals have a larger endowment. For public goods games with linear returns, we find such an advantage, thereby corroborating previous research. If returns follow a threshold function, however, aligned inequality results in inferior payoffs. These results show that the effect of inequality on cooperation depends on the kind of public goods game considered.",

          "authors": "Lin Bian, Renée Baillargeon",
          "abstract": "When outgroups are present, adults may endorse ingroup choices that are at odds with their personal preferences, in an outward show of ingroup loyalty. Here, we examined whether 2-y-old toddlers ( N = 108) might already understand such shows of loyalty. In three violation-of-expectation experiments, toddlers watched interactions among a target individual, an ingroup member, and an outgroup member; group memberships were marked with novel labels. In the critical trials, the target individual chose between an ingroup- and an outgroup-associated toy. When the outgroup member was present during this selection process, toddlers expected the target individual to conform to her group’s norm and select the ingroup-associated toy, even when they knew she preferred the outgroup-associated toy. This was true whether or not the ingroup member remained in the scene; as long as the outgroup member was present, toddlers expected the target individual to select the ingroup-associated toy and no other toy. When the outgroup member was absent, however, toddlers expected the target individual to act on her personal preference, if any. They also held this expectation if no information was provided about group memberships. Together, these results indicate that by 2 y of age, toddlers a) construe individuals as possessed of both a personal and a social identity, b) understand that individuals may produce different actions in different contexts depending on which identity has precedence, and c) expect individuals’ social identity to take precedence in intergroup contexts even when it conflicts with their personal identity, in a show of ingroup loyalty.",

          "abstract": "Based on observational studies, conventional wisdom suggests that citizenship carries economic benefits. We leverage a randomized experiment from New York where low-income registrants with permanent residency who wanted to become citizens entered a lottery to receive fee vouchers to naturalize. Voucher recipients were about 36 p.p. more likely to naturalize. Yet, we find no discernible effects of access to citizenship on multiple economic outcomes, including income, credit scores, access to credit, financial distress, and employment. Leveraging a multidimensional immigrant integration index, we similarly find no measurable effects on noneconomic integration. However, we do find that citizenship reduces fears of deportation. Explaining divergence from past studies, our results also reveal evidence of positive selection into citizenship, suggesting that observational studies are susceptible to selection bias.",

This article explores the reasons behind the failure of PRRPs to gain traction, focusing on the supply side of party competition and developing a more nuanced conceptualization of polarization. It argues that, at a critical moment when PRRPs were growing elsewhere, Scotland’s political landscape was shaped by symbiotic polarization, in which two established and opposing parties – the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Scottish Conservative Party – reinforced each other’s positions, entrenched by the Scottish independence and Brexit referendums. This dynamic constrained the emergence of PRRPs. Since 2022, however, this political balance has fractured, creating space for a disruptive polarizing force on the populist radical right. Scotland’s case highlights how patterns of polarization can inhibit or facilitate political challengers, offering broader insights into party system resilience and transformation.",

Utilising an innovative and flexible typology that moves beyond traditional dichotomous classifications, we distinguish between technocratic and non-technocratic ministers, considering dimensions such as expertise, partisanship and loyalty to the Prime Minister. Our analysis confirms the growing significance of technocrats – particularly the ‘academic technocrat’ – since the onset of the crisis, a trend that aligns with observations also evident in other European countries. Technocrats in Greece, as elsewhere, are frequently entrusted with portfolios focused on crisis management, further supporting patterns identified in comparative research. The influence of strong Prime Ministers and the rise of coalition governments during crisis explain these developments, mirroring factors found in broader European studies.",

          "authors": "Kris Dunn, Xinyu Wang, Christos Vrakopoulos",
          "abstract": "Can losers of once-in-a-generation referenda ever regain faith in democracy? Previous research indicates that elections and referenda can both lower losers’ satisfaction with democracy and increase that of the winners. As long as people win some in addition to losing some, there appears to be little concern that satisfaction will polarize along partisan lines. However, for once-in-a-generation referenda such as Britain’s EU Referendum, there is little chance for losers to chalk up a compensatory win, potentially exacerbating and solidifying the winner-loser gap. This research note extends previous research into the consequences of Britain’s EU Referendum on satisfaction with democracy by analyzing 5 years of panel data across the Brexit period—from the referendum announcement through to the UK’s exit from the EU. Our analyses demonstrate dramatic swings in winners’ and losers’ satisfaction with democracy across those 5 years, often corresponding with Brexit-related events. Most tellingly, after the United Kingdom finally left the EU, there is a notable, though modest, continuation of the winner-loser gap initially triggered by the EU Referendum outcome—suggesting once-in-a-generation referenda can durably fracture democratic satisfaction in ways regular elections do not. These findings have implications for democracies contemplating major constitutional or sovereignty referenda.",

          "abstract": "What is the impact of democratic transition on the party politics of neighboring democratic nations? While existing scholarship on democratic diffusion primarily focuses on how democratization influences authoritarian regimes, it often overlooks the cross-border effects on neighboring democracies. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of democratic transitions on party polarization and the issue salience of democracy in countries with democratic or hybrid regimes. Using the Manifesto Project and V-DEM’s regime transitions data sets and employing a difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment adoption, our analysis reveals a counterintuitive effect: democratic transitions in one country leads to a decrease in party polarization over democracy in neighboring countries. We posit this decline is a long-term phenomenon, linked to the diminishing salience of democracy as a key issue in party manifestos after a short period of initial prominence. By shifting the scholarly focus of diffusion effects to party politics within democratic and hybrid regimes, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how democratization ripples beyond its borders, shaping the political landscape in unanticipated ways.",

          "authors": "Daniel Driscoll, Max Kiefel, Mathias Larsen",
          "abstract": "Industrial policies are resurging across the world in response to climate change and geopolitical challenges. Current scholarship predominantly argues that state capacity for industrial policy depends on nationally oriented features, such as bureaucratic efficiency, financial resources, and expertise. However, the increasing uncertainties in globalized industrial supply chains mean that today, industrial policies must often expand into other countries to be successful. We propose complementing the domestically oriented dimension of state capacity with an internationally oriented one, drawing from the international political economy literature on state power. To demonstrate the merit of this approach, we analyze China's and the United States’ state capacity and actions to internationalize their electric vehicle industrial policies, in order to secure critical minerals. We find that both countries use their large market shares of global trade, while China leverages its powerful state bureaucracy and the United States its dominant military and macrofinancial regime. Thus, we argue that in order for a country to internationalize its industrial policy, a country must combine market dominance with capacities that are likely to be highly specific to their own comparative advantage.",

          "abstract": "Administrative burdens are deliberate policy choices, as governments can proactively design rules and procedures to shape burdens experienced by citizens. While existing research has examined the effects of burden reduction strategies, less is known about the factors driving burden reduction actions at the local level. This paper investigates why city governments adopt streamlining ordinances to reduce burdens in permit service delivery, focusing on the electric vehicle charging station permitting process. Using data from 482 California cities between 2015 and 2023, we find that cities with stronger fiscal capacity, more climate‐concerned, and whiter populations are more likely to institutionalize burden reduction practices in streamlining ordinances. Contrary to expectations, neither mass political ideology nor political leader (mayoral) partisanship has a significant impact on municipal permitting reforms. Our findings demonstrate how capacity constraints, distributive politics, and policy‐specific constituency preferences jointly shape local governments' willingness to reduce burdens in public service delivery.",

          "abstract": "Institutional distance shapes how private partners participate in cross‐country public–private partnership (PPP) projects, yet its effects remain underexplored. Drawing on organizational institutionalism, we argue that institutional distance generates adaptation pressures that prompt private partners to engage in sustained collaborations. Such collaborations lead private partners to build relationships and connect into networks, within which positional advantages are accumulated. Using data on 3223 PPP projects across 91 countries from 1998 to 2022, we establish longitudinal networks and measure three types of positional advantages: linkage, brokerage, and independence. Our results show that greater institutional distance is associated with the accumulation of these advantages over time. Moreover, host countries' involvement in economic‐political alliances moderates these relationships in contrasting ways, weakening the effect on linkage and brokerage advantages while strengthening the effect on independence advantages. We highlight implications for how governments can better support private partners' participation in cross‐country PPP projects.",

          "abstract": "The “racist cop” stereotype is one of the most prominent social representations of law enforcement in the United States. Drawing on theories of stereotype threat and stigma, this article suggests that this negative stereotype creates an identity threat that heightens anxiety and stress among law enforcement officers, increasing the risks of their burnout. Using survey data collected from officers in a state‐level law enforcement agency in 2021, we find that White officers, as well as those who reported greater stress during the 2020 protests, express stronger concerns about being perceived as racist. These concerns are associated with elevated levels of burnout, and efforts to maintain a positive self‐image partially mediate this relationship. These findings hold even after controlling for burnout levels reported by the same officers in 2019. Overall, our results extend stereotype‐threat research to a high‐power public service context and underscore the need for organizational interventions that reduce stereotype‐related stress and support officer well‐being.",

          "abstract": "We develop a model that integrates modern theories of labor market flows with nominal wage rigidities to study the consequences of inflation on the labor market. Nominal wage stickiness incentivizes workers to engage in job-to-job transitions after an unexpected increase in the price level. Such dynamics lead to a rise in aggregate vacancies associating a seemingly tight labor market with lower real wages—two facts observed during the recent inflation period. The calibrated model jointly matches aggregate and cross-sectional trends in worker flows and wages during the 2021-2024 period. Using historical data, we show that prior periods of high inflation were also associated with increasing vacancies and upward shifts in the Beveridge curve. Our results suggest that policymakers and academics should be cautious about viewing the rise in the vacancy-to-unemployment rate as a sign of a tight labor market during inflationary periods without holistically looking at other labor market indicators.",

          "abstract": "This paper studies the effects of automation in a task-based economy in which some jobs pay workers rents—wages above their outside option. We show that automation targets high-rent tasks, dissipating rents, amplifying wage losses, and reducing within-group wage dispersion in exposed groups. This form of rent dissipation is inefficient and offsets the productivity gains from automation. Using US data from 1980 to 2016, we find evidence of sizable rent dissipation and reduced within-group wage dispersion due to automation. Automation accounts for 52% of the increase in between-group inequality since 1980, with rent dissipation explaining one-fifth of this total. Our estimates imply that inefficient rent dissipation has offset 60–90% of the productivity gains from automation over this period.",

Droughts are a major driver of conflict in Africa, particularly between transhumant pastoralists and sedentary farmers. Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) piloted in Kenya provides automated, preemptive payouts to pastoralists affected by droughts. Combining variation in rainfall and the staggered rollout of IBLI in Kenya over the 2000-2020 period, we find that IBLI strongly reduces drought-induced conflict. Key mechanisms include a reduction in herd sizes, as well as income smoothing and asset-price stabilization, contributing to an overall reduced migratory pressure for pastoralists. Our study suggests that market-based solutions are a scalable, cost-effective pathway to mitigate conflict, complementing political solutions such as power-sharing agreements and institutional reforms.",

          "abstract": "We evaluate the efficiency of dynamic linked environmental regulation. Linked regulation allows inspectors who uncover violations at one plant to increase future enforcement at other plants that share a common owner. When compliance costs are correlated, regulators can then target scarce enforcement resources towards bad actors without inspecting everyone. We develop an empirical framework of dynamic moral hazard under linked regulation that allows for large portfolios of plants and for choices to be interdependent within the portfolio of plants and across time. Using the framework we evaluate a linked regulation scheme in Texas and find that linked regulation performs substantially better than both unlinked regulation and untargeted regulation. We test two alternative theoretical mechanisms that underpin the benefit—a “firm-wide moral hazard mechanism” and a “correlated targeting mechanism”—and find that a large share of the value of linked regulation is due to the former.",

We introduce a dynamic model in which a firm bargains with loss-averse workers about organizational change and wages.

In a crisis, workers concede to organizational change but resist nominal wage reductions. In addition, the model explains why different firms in the same industry often have significant productivity differences. Finally, the model demonstrates the importance of expectations management even if all parties have rational expectations.",

          "authors": "Martin Abel, Rulof Burger",
          "abstract": "We investigate the extent and underlying mechanisms behind race beliefs on hiring decisions. In an incentivized experiment, workers with names perceived to be Black are 30 percentage points less likely to be hired. Results indicate that race serves as a decision heuristic: large perceived race gaps among candidates lead to faster and more confident decisions, and the race gap in hiring increases by 25% when employers are forced to make quick decisions. Estimates from a drift-diffusion model reveal that most employers initially focus on worker race, but certain employer groups shift their attention to productivity-related attributes when given sufficient time.",

          "authors": "Colleen Carey, Nolan Miller, David Molitor",
          "abstract": "Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) awards rise in recessions, especially for workers over age 50. We use Medicare data to investigate how health, entry costs, and age-based DI eligibility rules shape this pattern. Entrants induced by recessions have lower medical spending and mortality than typical recipients. Entry responses to unemployment jump two- to fourfold at ages 50 and 55, when eligibility rules relax. Using these age-based discontinuities as instruments, we find no shift in marginal entrants' health across unemployment levels. These findings show that DI's age-based eligibility rules are a primary driver of cyclical entry, while health shocks are not.",

          "abstract": "The effect of health insurance on consumption risk depends in part on how it interacts with other risks beyond health care cost risk, such as income risk. Using a variety of approaches, I find that for U.S. households, the interaction with other risks transforms the risk protection from health insurance. Standard contracts amplify the impact of other risks, due to both subsidizing normal goods and undoing the protection against other risks from discounts, charity care, and bad debt. Alternative contracts that account for other risks, such as contracts that limit out-of-pocket spending relative to income, can provide better risk protection.",

          "abstract": "Global phenomena, such as climate change, often have local impacts that are spatially correlated. We show that greater spatial correlation of productivities can increase international inequality by increasing the correlation between a country's productivity and its gains from trade. We confirm this prediction using a half-century of exogenous variation in the spatial correlation of agricultural productivities induced by a global climatic phenomenon. We introduce this general-equilibrium effect into projections of climate-change impacts that typically omit spatial linkages and therefore do not account for the global scope of climate change. We project greater international inequality, with higher welfare losses across Africa.",

          "abstract": "Competition authorities have expressed concern that firms selling broadband internet and TV subscriptions may employ usage-based pricing (UBP) of internet to steer consumers toward TV over streaming video. We study this issue with household-level panel data from an internet service provider's UBP experiment, capturing the prices' effects on internet and TV subscriptions, internet usage, and firm revenue. We find that this specific UBP policy largely served to meter internet usage by high-demand households rather than steer them toward TV. Households' payments increased due to usage-related overage charges and internet subscription upgrades to avoid overages. Some households avoided internet-related payments by reducing usage rather than adding TV subscriptions.",

Using large-scale experiments, I test whether people engage in motivated reasoning to overly trust “good” or “bad” news with minimal functional and ego relevance. Results show a precisely-estimated null effect for motivated reasoning in either direction, and modest effects can be ruled out. Complementary survey evidence finds that participants expect good news to increase happiness but not to systematically bias inference. Results suggest that belief-based utility is insufficient for distorting inference to favor preferred beliefs.",

          "abstract": "This paper documents the bias introduced by attrition of individuals from administrative data with an application to the labor market consequences of postsecondary education. Attrition due to crossstate migration is non-trivial, particularly for high-earners, graduates from selective universities, and certain majors. Consequently, the premium associated with graduating from a most selective university is 23% higher than in-state earnings suggests, though this magnitude differs across context. The impact of obtaining a 2-year CTE credential is also understated, as are earnings differences across majors. Differences in missingness are systematically related to bias in measurement; we evaluate approaches to quantifying that bias.",

Our identification strategy exploits multivariate monotonicity in parametric indices, and uses the logical contraposition of an intertemporal inequality on choice probabilities to obtain identifying restrictions. We provide a consistent estimation procedure, and demonstrate the practical advantages of our method with Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical illustration on popcorn sales with the NielsenIQ data.",

The model shows that a reduction in competition exacerbates the inefficiency created by adverse selection but can ameliorate the inefficiency created by advantageous selection. However, reduced competition never corrects the inefficiency perfectly because it introduces an allocative inefficiency. By contrast, the inefficiency can be corrected perfectly through a corrective tax when there is perfect competition. Our results have implications for competition policy in credit and insurance markets, as they caution against viewing imperfect competition as a solution to the inefficiencies created by selection.",

A key novelty of our approach is to account for the effect of the data-driven selection, yielding a new critical value constructed on the basis of a nonstandard truncated-Gaussian asymptotic approximation. We show that the test is correctly sized and attains a well-defined sense of adaptiveness that may result in better power than existing methods. The improvement afforded by the new test is demonstrated in a Monte Carlo study and an empirical application on the conditional evaluation of inflation forecasts.",

          "abstract": "Many social insurance programs have low take-up, but it is unclear whether this is due to administrative barriers, information, or low insurance valuations. We study a Thai policy that offered large incentives for informal workers in selected provinces to enroll. The incentives increased insurance coverage by 67 percentage points- from 6 percent of informal workers to 73 percent- within two months. However, 12 months later, only 13 percent remained insured. Using choices among insurance tiers to back out revealed valuations, we find that low social insurance enrollment may be due to low ex-ante valuations of insurance, rather than administrative barriers.",

Most US sick leave schemes operate as individualized credit accounts: Paid leave is earned, and unused leave accumulates. We construct a unique dataset of daily leave balances and behavior among 982 teachers for 2010–2018. Sick leave use increases during flu season, and evidence indicates that the average teacher does not use sick leave for leisure, though some subsets of teachers (e.g., the young and inexperienced) do. Usage increases with leave balance; the elasticity is around 0.4. Further, teachers with higher balances are less likely to work sick, particularly during flu season.",

I identify causal effects using a triple-difference design comparing exports across municipalities with varying bank access and across destinations to control for contemporaneous shocks including the financial crisis. Firm-level analysis finds that local currency adoption increased export values significantly, with effects concentrated among non-commodity exporters. These results demonstrate that foreign currency dependence constitutes a meaningful barrier to emerging market trade.",

Firms choose where to produce and how to finance the production. They can access external finance, but capital market imperfections prevent them from relying exclusively on it for affiliate production, giving rise to FDI. The model rationalizes the three-way relationship between MP, FDI, and financial market conditions that we document and leads to novel welfare implications. Quantification of the model highlights the relevance of these welfare implications and the importance of financial factors in shaping the activities of multinationals.",

Considering Chinese population policy to be extreme in global experience, our paper demonstrates the limits of population policy — and its potential human costs.",

Finally, we provide statistical inference methods that can leverage modern machine learning algorithms for estimation. These results allow empirical researchers to perform sensitivity analyses in a flexible class of machine-learned causal models using very simple tools.

The effect is concentrated in the seven days following media exposure and is strongest when refugee coverage is negative and highlights criminality. Results are not driven by changes in customer composition or perceived audit risk. Instead, our findings suggest that public scrutiny prompts minorities to counter negative stereotypes by increasing their compliance.",

Yet, the decision-making mechanisms that underlie social foraging in the real world remain unknown. Integrating high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking and video footage from large-scale foraging competitions with cognitive-computational modeling and agent-based simulations, we show how foragers integrate personal, social, and ecological information to guide spatial search and patch-leaving decisions. We show how the social context emerges as a key driver of foraging dynamics. Foragers adaptively rely on social information to locate resources when unsuccessful and extend giving-up times in the presence of others, which results in increased area-restricted search at high social densities. These findings demonstrate the importance of sociality for human foraging decisions and provide a template for harnessing high-resolution tracking data to study real-world cognition.",

          "abstract": "This study presents the first comparative analysis of late nineteenth and early twentieth century racial-environmental inequality formation. Previously, lack of data on early industrial hazards contributed to a structural division between urban and environmental theory, as sociologists have had limited understanding of the relationship between environmental and racial inequality during the initial formation of segregated neighborhoods. As a result, socioenvironmental processes are often considered a downstream outcome of persistent patterns of urban inequality, rather than a potential cause. In response, this study uses a novel computational methodology to map sites associated with an acute and widespread source of early industrial pollution. Site data are paired with historical census information to analyze changes in the social stratification of environmental exposure in six US urban areas from 1880 to 1930. Results reveal a sustained and generalized escalation in exposure to environmental hazards among racialized populations, despite substantial local variation at the beginning of the study period, suggesting that racial-environmental inequality emerged much earlier than prior studies have shown—and that socioenvironmental processes likely played an important role in the racialization of the neighborhood. Findings further suggest new directions to embed urban sociology within a socioenvironmental perspective.",

          "authors": "Niko Pyrhönen, Gwenaëlle Bauvois, Anton Berg, Peter Holley",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how ordinary Americans engage in unprompted conspiracy talk when discussing their daily lives. Drawing on a representative sample of 1,612 life course interviews from the “American Voices Project”, we explore how conspiracy theories surface in reflections on topics people consider important—such as relationships, employment, religion, and politics. Using both computational and qualitative analysis, we identify instances of conspiracy talk in the corpus, and categorize these passages into three orientations: supporting, challenging, and referencing conspiracy talk. Notably, 10 percent of the interview transcripts contain some form of conspiracy talk—a striking figure given that no questions about conspiracies or conspiracy theories were asked. While the overall volume of conspiracy talk rose during the pandemic, this increase was largely driven by a fivefold increase in passages that challenge conspiracy theories. Building on the recent theoretical work on conspiracy theories and conspiracy culture, this study highlights the value of empirically grounded analysis focused on ordinary people—not just dedicated conspiracy theorists or participants in, or followers of, the conspiracy theory milieu. In doing so, we offer new insights into how conspiracy theories are discussed, negotiated, and made meaningful in the course of everyday life.",

          "authors": "Danielle Levitan",
          "abstract": "Most countries legally recognize the right and duty to raise the child one has carried and given birth to, (i) reflecting a traditional legal presumption (despite widespread abuse and neglect) that parents should be granted wide‐ranging legal rights with respect to their minor children. What interests me here is the moral aspect of the right to childrearing: does childrearing have a value that is objective, and if so, why? In this paper, I explore a theory of intrinsic value that is consistent with an objective stance on childrearing. The theory enables us to make sense of the belief that something can be objectively good as an end‐in‐itself even if a person derives no pleasure from it, thus grounding the distinction between the good of childrearing and the pleasure one might gain from it. This paper is divided into three parts. Section 1 explores the concept of intrinsic goodness. I explain what I mean by ‘childrearing’ as distinguished from procreation, and argue that childrearing is both an objective and intrinsic good. Section 2 clarifies how this works, maintaining that the intimate relationship between parent and child makes the parent's life richer and more worthwhile. (ii) I argue further that childrearing is a component of well‐being rather than an instrumental cause of it. Section 3 sketches three types of theories outlined by Derek Parfit (iii) regarding what is good for a person: hedonistic theories, desire‐fulfilment theories, and objective‐list theories (iv).",

          "abstract": "This study addresses the complexities of midpoint and non-substantive responses, such as “Don’t Know,” in Likert scale surveys on gender attitudes. While existing research often assumes these responses are neutral or random, this study challenges that notion by applying the item response tree model to disentangle respondents’ attitudes from their response tendencies. Analysis of data from the Chinese General Social Survey shows that traditional gender attitudes are associated with a higher likelihood of such responses, indicating biases in conventional methods. After disentangling these elements, I reassemble them through latent profile analysis to examine the dominant configurations of gender attitudes and response tendencies. Five distinct profiles emerge: Passionate Egalitarians, Genuine Neutrals, Forthright Moderates, Evasive Traditionalists, and Unembellished Traditionalists. Passionate Egalitarians advocate strongly for gender equality, while Evasive Traditionalists use non-substantive responses to conceal traditional views. This study provides a refined approach to rating scale analysis, advancing both sociological methodology and gender studies.",

          "authors": "William Scarborough, Cynthia Brito, Aïsha Lehmann, Iván Arenas, Amanda Lewis",
          "abstract": "As part of the largest and most expensive state-run immigration program in U.S. history, the state of Texas bused more than 100,000 immigrants to six Democratic-led cities with sanctuary ordinances between 2022 and 2024. In this research note, we examine whether the Texas migrant busing program led to an increase in Hispanic homelessness in cities that received buses chartered by the state. Using point-in-time data measuring local homeless populations from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and administrative data from the Office of the Texas Governor to identify busing destinations, we apply a series of fixed-effects individual slope models to estimate the impact of Texas's busing program on local rates of Hispanic homelessness. We find that the busing program led to an annual increase of 36% in Hispanic homelessness in destination cities relative to prebusing trends. These results are robust to counterfactuals showing that the busing program had no impact on non-Hispanic homelessness, consistent with the predominantly Hispanic composition of bused migrants. Our findings underscore the detrimental impact of the Texas busing program on Hispanic homelessness and offer policy solutions to mitigate its effects.",

          "abstract": "Great-grandparents are key figures in the transmission of family history and values. Despite their recognized importance, there is scant population-based research estimating the prevalence of great-grandparents in the contemporary United States. This research note uses the most recently available nationally representative survey data to characterize great-grandparenthood in the United States from 1996 until 2012, when the Health and Retirement Study ceased asking harmonizable great-grandparenthood questions. The prevalence of great-grandparenthood increases steadily with age, from 11% of 60‒64-year-olds, to just over half at ages 80‒84, to about two thirds of those 90 or older. There has been surprising little change over the cohorts prior to the baby boom, but cohorts born after 1942 have lower rates of great-grandparenthood in their 50s and early 60s. Great-grandparenthood is somewhat more prevalent among women than men and is strongly patterned by educational attainment, with distinct patterns and levels for those with and without a college degree. Finally, we estimate that the number of great-grandparents in the United States has increased from 15.3 million in 1996 to 20.4 million in 2012, highlighting a 33% increase. This increase is due to population aging, coming despite slight declines in the proportion of individuals over 50 with great-grandchildren.",

          "authors": "Siyun Peng, Brea L. Perry, Adam R. Roth",
          "abstract": "A growing number of social scientists are using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to observe how social forces operate in real time. However, the validity of EMA for measuring features of daily life—what people are doing, where, and with whom—remains uncertain. A key challenge is the lack of consensus across studies about how validity in EMA methods is defined and assessed. The authors address that gap by comparing EMA data (n = 1,174) with time diary data (n = 1,113) using two population-based samples. An advantage of large samples is the ability to evaluate the magnitude of bias rather than relying solely on p-values, as is common in small-sample studies. The authors find that both methods yield similar estimates of moments captured at home and in the workplace, supporting their validity in those contexts. However, EMA tends to overestimate moments spent alone compared with time diaries, likely because of moment selection bias. Moreover, large discrepancies in estimates for eating and drinking and household chores suggest that relying on primary activity reports can introduce significant bias for multitasked activities. Comparing these methods provides insight into their relative strengths and limitations, helping researchers assess the validity, potential biases, and interpretive implications of each across key domains of daily life.",

          "authors": "Sean Farhang, Gregory J. Wawro, Michael E. Sobel",
          "abstract": "We study the relationship between trial judge attributes and monetary outcomes in cases brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We define an estimand, the average feature comparison (AFC), that addresses whether or not a case outcome would differ were it assigned to a judge of one type as opposed to another—here male versus female, White versus non‐White, or Republican versus Democratic appointee. We develop a framework for estimating the AFC that takes into consideration which judges are eligible to be randomly assigned to given cases. We find the probability a case results in nonzero relief is greater if that case were assigned to a non‐White judge than to a White judge, but the relief amount is not. For gender (party), we do not find evidence that the monetary outcome of a case would be different if it was assigned to a male (Democrat) rather than a female (Republican) judge.",

          "abstract": "When elected officials gain power, do they use it to provide more constituent service or affect policy? The answer informs debates over how legislator capacity, term limits, and institutional positions affect legislator behavior. We distinguish two countervailing effects of increased institutional power: shifting priorities and increased capacity. To assess how institutional power shapes behavior, we assemble a massive new database of 611,239 legislator requests to a near census of federal departments, agencies, and subagencies between 2007 and 2020. We find that legislators prioritize policy work as they gain institutional power (e.g., become a committee chair) but simultaneously maintain their levels of constituency service. Moreover, when a new legislator replaces an experienced legislator, the district receives less constituency service and less policy work. Rather than long‐serving and powerful elected officials diverting attention from constituents, their increased capacity enables them to maintain levels of constituency service, even as they prioritize policy work.",

          "abstract": "Existing literature posits that attitudes toward immigration are shaped by the impact of migrants on native workers' wages and employment, as well as by various other material, cultural, and social concerns. However, empirically disentangling these influences can be challenging. By taking advantage of the fact that different types of labor migrants, namely either taking residence and working in a country or commuting over an international border, equally affect labor market competition but have different cultural and social implications, we strive to identify the effect of labor migration on attitudes toward migration. We empirically investigate this phenomenon using two experiments embedded within a representative survey in Switzerland, one priming and one conjoint experiment. Results robustly show that natives evaluate resident foreigners more positively than cross‐border commuters and that levels of exposure and fairness aspects explain this preference.",

However, with the evolving media landscape altering how we consume news, many contemporary agenda-setting studies still rely on decade-old guidelines to determine time lags instead of empirically testing them.

Results show that, on average, it took 55 days of media exposure (accumulation) for the agenda-setting effect to appear at the aggregated level and 28 days at the individual level, with public response lagging by about 7 days (delay). Additionally, media agenda setting tends to take longer to manifest at higher levels and occur more quickly in collectivist societies compared to individualist ones.",

          "abstract": "The literature presents two contrasting accounts on how cognitive reflection (overriding intuition with deliberation) influences susceptibility to political misinformation. According to the classical reasoning account, predominantly rooted in research on soft news, cognitive reflection improves discernment of true from false information. According to the motivated reasoning account, rooted in research on hard (policy‐related) issues, individuals prone to cognitive reflection display stronger political bias and fall for politically congruent misinformation. We integrate these accounts by examining how the soft‐hard distinction interacts with individuals' reasoning style to shape truth discernment and susceptibility to political bias. An integrative data analysis (IDA) combined data from 18 political misinformation studies ( N = 41,289) with independent soft‐hard news ratings. Additionally, two experiments ( N = 666), in the United States and Greece, exposed participants to either soft or hard news. Across all datasets, participants prone to cognitive reflection displayed stronger political bias, but only when evaluating hard news. Cognitive reflection was associated with improved truth discernment for soft and hard news in the IDA, but not consistently so in the experiments. Our findings reconcile discrepancies in misinformation research and demonstrate that cognitive reflection is not a one‐size‐fits‐all solution to political misinformation as it can exacerbate bias in policy‐related issues.",

How do we make sense of these seemingly contradictory parallel trends? In four studies ( N = 996), we find that support for unions is high in the United States. However, we find that support varies based on both individual‐ and group‐level factors. Specifically, conservatism and system‐justifying ideologies are negatively related to union support, whereas structural attributions for poverty are positively related to union support. We also find left–right ideological differences in union support; conservatives are less likely to support unions overall (but are relatively more supportive of police unions) compared to liberals. In contrast, liberals are more supportive of labor unions more generally than conservatives, and are more likely to support teachers' unions than police unions. Overall, support for unions is high but not generalized; worldviews, ideology, and type of labor differentiate that support.",

          "abstract": "Party cues can influence public opinion, but the extent to which they do so varies dramatically from context to context. Why? The long‐standing theory that party cues function as “heuristics” provides an answer, predicting that variation in exposure to policy information, a propensity for effortful thinking, or both causally affects the influence of party cues. However, this prediction has escaped decisive empirical testing to date, leaving in its wake a string of mixed results. Here we characterize the challenges that limit previous tests, and report on two large‐scale experiments designed to overcome them. We find that exposure to policy information causally attenuates the influence of party cues, but engagement in effortful thinking per se does not. Our results advance understanding of the “when” and “why” of party cue influence; clarify a number of previously ambiguous findings; and have broad theoretical, methodological, and normative implications for understanding the influence of party cues.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive evidence that emotion and cognition are deeply intertwined, the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) lacks an analytically independent emotional mechanism in its causal architecture—an omission that may be particularly consequential in policy subsystems structured around morally charged, identity‐laden policy disputes. To bridge this gap, this conceptual article focuses on patterns of coalition membership and examines how policymakers navigate their roles across policy subsystems. At times, they act as emotionally anchored members of advocacy coalitions; at other times, they promote coalition aims without such anchoring; and in yet other contexts, they operate through technocratic discourse guided by expertise, evidence, or institutional duty—outside coalition dynamics, though never entirely impartial. The article proposes novel theoretical extensions, including emotional anchoring of policymakers , affective policy subsystems , and affective brokerage , to better capture the mechanisms through which emotions shape coalition membership, often independently of or prior to belief alignment. To the extent that emotional anchoring is durable, its effect can persist over time, shaping coalition stability, strategic behavior, policy‐oriented learning, and policy change. To operationalize these extensions, the article explores methods for measuring externally expressed and internally felt emotions.",

In social sciences, intergenerational transmission of education is often used as an indicator of inequality of opportunity. However, this neglects the role of genes. Twin studies parse out the effects of genes, the shared environment and the non-shared environment. This study uses population-wide data on twins and siblings from integral registers of Statistics Netherlands to assess trends in genetic influence (‘heritability’) and the influence of the shared environment on educational attainment in birth cohorts 1964–1997, including trends in gene × SES interactions. We adapt the classical twin design to estimate heritability in the absence of zygosity information. We found no evidence that inequality increased. In contrast, heritability of educational attainment increased and the shared environmental influence decreased between 1964 and 1970 and again between 1992 and 1997. Furthermore, the 1964–1979 cohort group but not the 1980–1997 cohort group showed a gene × SES interaction: heritability was lower in the lowest SES group than in the highest SES group.",

          "abstract": "The expansion of higher educational systems in Western countries in the latter half of the 20th century is central to the reversal of the gender gap in education. In Norway, major reforms starting in the late 1960s aimed at making higher education more accessible for large segments of the population. This occurred through the establishment, upgrading, and gradual expansion of local colleges across the country, especially in female-dominated fields associated with work in expanding welfare sectors. Previous research has suggested that the gendered profile of educational expansions contributed to the cementing of horizontal gender segregation patterns in education and the labour market. We shed light on these processes using new and detailed data on the establishment and upgrading of higher educational institutions between 1969 and 1992. Linking these to individual-level register data, we study how regional variation in educational opportunities affected the educational attainment and field of study choices of young women and men, using an event study approach. While increased access to college education was a prerequisite for the reversal of the gender gap, our results suggest that the location of colleges had, at most, a very modest impact on local educational attainment and gendered field of study choices.",

          "abstract": "A basic premise of research on welfare state spending is that electoral incentives matter, with voters backing programme expansion and opposing retrenchment. However, the evidence supporting this premise is mixed. Departing from previous studies, we argue that these apparent null effects arise from an emphasis on the generosity of social benefits rather than their distribution . Shifting attention to the latter, we argue that individual preferences over the allocation of welfare spending depend on their relationship to economic vulnerability. Individuals in secure economic situations support schemes with benefits proportional to contributions, while those in more vulnerable positions favour systems based on recipient need. These heterogeneous preferences translate into public evaluations of policymaker performance, providing a pathway for the electoral connection. We test this argument in two stages. First, we use data from the European Social Survey to examine how individual precarity shapes preferences for needs-based versus contributory pensions. Second, we use the Executive Approval Database to assess how the composition of pension expenditures and perceptions of debt affect government support across eleven European welfare states from 1986 to 2019. Study findings provide evidence consistent with our theoretical expectations. Results highlight the micro-level foundations of policymakers’ electoral incentives and provide a path forward for specifying connections between the allocation of social policy spending and mass politics.",

However, identities also form around ideological divisions such as liberal/conservative or left/right, particularly in contexts where ideological divisions are more permanent than parties. In this paper, we study ideological identities and how they influence interpersonal affect. In our survey ( n = 2152), conducted in Germany, many individuals declare ideological identities, and these are of similar strength as partisan identities. We also run a conjoint survey experiment where respondents evaluate individuals with varying personal characteristics and, crucially, see varying amounts of information: only ideological affiliation, or also partisanship, policy stances, and/or political interest. We find that ideological affiliation matters for how respondents evaluate individuals, even when extensive additional information is present. However, ideology is slightly less relevant than partisanship, while policy stances are privileged over both. Our findings imply that we should broaden our lens in studying affective polarization to encompass political identities beyond partisanship.",

          "abstract": "Many affluent democracies have pledged to achieve ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century. Achieving these targets would denote important national contributions to the international goal of keeping global warming ‘well below’ 2°C as agreed in the 2015 Paris agreement. Yet pursuing the necessary long-term decarbonisation policies influencing individuals’ everyday lives will require a considerable and enduring level of political leadership. But what enables or constrains politicians to perform such leadership? To date, little is known about the factors influencing politicians’ willingness to advocate for decarbonisation measures in the short-term for the long-term gain of climate change mitigation. This study draws on rare data of consumers’ carbon footprints, parliamentary speechmaking, and qualitative elite interviews in a mixed-methods research design to study how the intensity of constituents’ consumption-based carbon emissions influences the decarbonisation-focused behaviour of members of parliament (MPs) in the UK. Our quantitative findings reveal that MPs pay considerably less attention to decarbonisation issues when they represent carbon-intense constituencies. Moreover, this effect is particularly pronounced for Conservative MPs and amplified in marginal seats. The qualitative interview evidence helps to contextualise these quantitative findings, suggesting that MPs consider the decarbonisation of lifestyles a crucial political challenge and that their electoral considerations and party-political contexts play an important role in how they handle this challenge. Overall, our study draws a sobering picture of politicians’ willingness to sacrifice short-term electoral gains for the long-term prospect of net zero, especially for those MPs representing constituencies that could make high-impact contributions to nationwide emission cuts.",

          "authors": "Karl Loxbo, Brigitte Pircher",
          "abstract": "While European integration has transformed national parliaments, its long-term impact on conflicts between governments and opposition parties remains insufficiently understood. This study addresses that gap by analysing how Sweden’s accession to the European Union (EU) in 1995 altered the patterns of parliamentary opposition. Using longitudinal data on government proposals in the Swedish parliament, 1970–2022, we apply a difference-in-differences design to compare opposition intensity before and after accession. Our findings reveal two major transformations. First, we identify a sustained decline in opposition in internationally embedded economic and tax policies, supporting the view that the EU political system structurally depoliticises economic governance. Second, we observe a gradual but pronounced politicisation in policy areas tied to national identity and social welfare, where EU competences are limited and domestic discretion remains. We thus find that European integration reshapes parliamentary conflict by dampening opposition in economic policymaking while intensifying contestation in policy areas related to national identity and social protection. Rather than reducing opposition overall, EU membership redirects it across issue areas. Taken together, the results show that the distribution of national and supranational competences conditions parliamentary opposition. As Sweden is a most likely case of EU-induced cleavage transformation, similar dynamics are likely across other member states as well. The study advances parliamentary research by shifting attention from formal powers and debates to observable opposition behaviour over time. It also adds to theories of modern-day cleavage formation by providing evidence that European integration reduces conflict in economic policy while intensifying identity-based divides.",

          "authors": "Mario Angst, Neitah Noemi Müller, Viviane Walker, Myriam Pham-Truffert",
          "abstract": "Recent research in sustainability science has highlighted the crucial role of imaginaries, stories and narratives in shaping how sustainability governance is understood. One example is Adloff and Neckel’s framework of ideal-typical sustainability trajectories: modernization, transformation and control. This article examines how these trajectories can help analyse sustainability policy making when viewed through the theoretical lens of the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF). To do this, we reinterpret the sustainability trajectories as policy paradigms and identify the broader cultural and institutional macro-level narratives that underpin them. We ask how these overarching sustainability policy paradigms shape the way specific sustainability-related policy processes unfold. Empirically, we analyse how macro-level narratives within the modernization and transformation paradigms influence local policy discourse on sustainable urban transport in the Swiss city of Zürich over a 12-year period. Methodologically, the study introduces an innovative approach for assessing how actors’ ideal-typical discourse network positions align with macro-level narratives, and how these patterns structure actual policy discourse networks. Our findings provide some evidence that macro-level narratives do influence the structure of policy discourse. More broadly, the results suggest that the policy paradigms of modernization, transformation and control offer valuable starting points for applying the NPF to sustainability-related policy domains. For policy makers, these paradigms also provide a useful way to situate and interpret the stories told in everyday policy making.",

          "abstract": "Occupational licensing—the requirement that individuals attain a license to legally perform a specific job—is now necessary for over a fifth of the US workforce. The policy is intended to protect consumers by ensuring members of licensed occupations meet a minimum quality standard but comes at the cost of higher prices for their services. Economic theory and research support the argument that at least in some cases the costs of licensure exceed its benefits. Incumbent members of licensed occupations gain from the higher wages caused by licensure policies, creating a strong incentive for them to push for stricter regulations and resist any efforts to remove or loosen licensure requirements. However, despite bipartisan interest in licensure reform, data limitations and vast heterogeneity in licensure policies limit the usefulness of existing research in guiding its design.",

          "abstract": "Falling fertility and improved mortality create a powerful and inexorable demographic arithmetic of ageing in the coming decades around the world, with three patterns. The richest countries, along with China and the Former Soviet Union, will see absolute declines in the labor force aged (15-64) population and absolute rises in those 65 plus. All major developing country regions except for Africa: Latin America, South-East Asia and Pacific, South Asia, and West Asia/Middle East, will experience modest labor force growth to 2050 (less than 30 percent) aged combined with rapid growth of those over 65 (doubling or tripling). The fall in fertility in Africa (Sub-Saharan and North) started later and has fallen much less and hence, in standard scenarios for 2050, Africa will account for 80 percent of all global net growth in the world’s labor force aged. A fundamental feature of the global economy over the medium-run to 2050 is that that highest labor productivity countries will have absolutely fewer native-born workers and Africa, home to many of the world’s lowest productivity countries, will have 800 million more labor force aged. The combination makes possible gains on the order of trillions of dollars to policies that creating legal pathways to allow people, particularly youth, to move from low productivity, labor abundance places to high productivity, labor scarcity places. But, so far, politics has not found the way to “yes” for this win-win scenario.",

Over 1990–2019, migrants from India, China, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines accounted for over one-third of US growth in software developers and a quarter of the increase in scientists, engineers, and physicians. Using census microdata, visa records, and administrative sources, I show how growing US demand for talent in information technology, higher education, and healthcare interacted with Asia’s demographic and educational transformations. Policy reforms in the H-1B, F-1, and J-1 programs and sectoral shifts—such as the internet revolution and aging-related healthcare demand—generated persistent needs for foreign students and workers. Asian economies were uniquely positioned to meet this demand through tertiary expansion, strong STEM institutions, English proficiency, and diaspora networks. These inflows boosted US innovation while fostering “brain gain” and “brain circulation” in Asia.",

          "abstract": "Much of the observed cross-country variation in fertility aligns with the predictions of classic theories of the fertility transition: countries with higher levels of human capital, higher GDP per capita, or lower mortality rates tend to exhibit lower fertility. However, when examining changes within countries over the past 60 years, larger fertility declines are only weakly associated with greater improvements in human capital, per capita GDP, or survival rates. To understand why, we focus on the role of family institutions, particularly marriage and inheritance customs. We argue that, together with the diffusion of cultural norms, they help explain variations in the timing, speed and magnitude of the fertility decline. We propose a stylized model integrating economic, health, institutional and cultural factors to study how these factors interact to shape fertility transition paths. We find that family institutions can mediate the effect of economic development by constraining fertility responses.",

          "abstract": "For over 600 years, debates over noncompete clauses have centered on whether they function as efficient contracting tools or anticompetitive restraints on workers. This article reassesses that debate in light of recent policy attention and new empirical and theoretical research. Proponents argue that noncompetes are necessary to protect investments in training and trade secrets, increasing productivity and wages. However, recent studies indicate that the widespread use of noncompetes—frequently extending beyond roles involving sensitive information—and their enforceability lower mobility, wages, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Moreover, in many cases, less restrictive contractual terms appear to safeguard firm interests. Evidence of spillovers to other workers and across state boundaries, as well as behavioral effects even when noncompetes are unenforceable, raises questions about whether existing state-level enforcement regimes adequately address their observed impacts.",

          "abstract": "The traditional theoretical and empirical “micro approach” to studying labor market power (or monopsony) requires that firms are small and atomistic. This is at odds with the reality of labor markets in which monopsony potentially matters most. Empirically, many markets are concentrated and characterized by large, dominant employers. The actions of large employers in an occupation or industry affect local and national wages, employment and output. Employers that understand their largeness may then act strategically when hiring and setting wages, generating misallocation and harming workers. This paper advocates for a “macro approach”: (1) directly model equilibrium behavior of large employers, (2) combine macro data and empirical estimates of employers’ responses to policy changes—obtained using the “micro approach”—to estimate the model, (3) use the model to compute the aggregate costs of monopsony, and optimal policies. This approach provides new perspectives on minimum wage and antitrust policy.",

Channels assessed include transfers from working-age adults to children and the elderly, the effect of the labor force growth rate on required capital investment, sustainability of government debt, the interaction of population size with fixed natural resources (including a clean environment), and the effect of population size on the speed of technological progress. To isolate the effect of low fertility from other ongoing demographic changes, I use simulation models as well as projections from the United Nations and Social Security Administration that vary fertility rates while holding other factors constant. My main finding is that the impact of low fertility is likely to be negative but small. In addition, this negative impact arrives only after a long adjustment period. An increase in fertility back to the replacement rate would lower the standard of living for several decades.",

          "abstract": "For the world as a whole, average birth rates have been falling for decades—from about 5 in 1950 to a little above 2 today. Two-thirds of people today live in a country where the birth rate is below an average of two children per two adults, which means below the fertility level needed to sustain population sizes (without net migration). In this paper, we assess whether low fertility is likely to persist as a global phenomenon. We distinguish cohort birth rates, which matter for generation-to-generation population change, from period birth rates, which present a snapshot of birth rates at a point in time, but may offer less insight on longer-run possibilities. Where cohort birth rates have fallen low, they have not subsequently rebounded. We show that both increasing rates of lifetime childlessness and smaller family sizes among parents have contributed to falling cohort birth rates. Pronatal policies, we discuss, can have large effects on the annual fertility data without substantially changing the average number of children women have over their lifetimes. Although future birth rates remain uncertain, we conclude from the evidence that, over a long horizon, persistent low fertility is a likely future.",

Although the existence of labor market power has long been recognized, evidence only recently emerged that such market power regularly arises from sources that are actionable under antitrust law. Since 2010, antitrust agencies have substantially increased labor market enforcement actions. However, many questions relevant to enforcement remain unanswered, such as how to conduct market definition for labor markets and how best to incorporate concentration into models of the labor market. This article reviews how antitrust is beginning to be used in labor markets, the evidence for and against its use, and the remaining evidence gaps standing in the way of more effective use.",

          "abstract": "After Pinochet’s military coup in 1973, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) coordinated the resettlement of thousands of refugees from Chile. An unusual destination was Romania, which admitted the largest number of refugees in communist Eastern Europe. Yet this symbolic gesture soon proved unsustainable: by 1977, nearly 450 of the 1,500 Chileans resettled in Romania had fled again, seeking asylum in Western Europe. This article traces this ‘second escape’ and examines how UNHCR responded to this secondary movement. It first reconstructs the international effort to resettle Chileans across the Iron Curtain and highlights Romania’s strategic motivations. It then explores how deteriorating conditions led to renewed flight. Finally, it analyses UNHCR’s reluctance to acknowledge the program’s failure. The article argues that, under High Commissioner Sadruddin Aga Khan, resettlement became a tool of Cold War diplomacy—expanding UNHCR’s global footprint at the expense of its protective mandate.",

Drawing on qualitative interviews with representatives from twelve organizations, we analyze how these groups mobilized to support queer Ukrainian refugees. Our theoretical contribution lies in advancing the concept of ambivalent intersectional solidarity, which captures the tensions and exclusions that arise even within seemingly unified solidarity efforts. We argue that solidarity cannot be assumed to be inherently inclusive simply because actors share one or more axes of identity (e.g., queerness). Instead, we show how intersectionality—as both a lived experience and an analytic lens—reveals the contested nature of solidarity in contexts marked by historical trauma and geopolitical asymmetries.",

This paper bridges a gap between computer and political science in multimodal data analysis using audio. The adoption of multimodal analyses in political science (e.g., video/audio with text-as-data approaches) has been relatively slow due to unequal distribution of computational power and skills needed. We provide solutions to challenges encountered when analyzing audio, advancing the potential for multimodal data analysis in political science. Using a dataset of all televised U.S. presidential debates from 1960 to 2020, we focus on three features encountered when analyzing audio data: low-level descriptors (LLDs), such as pitch or energy; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs); and audio embeddings/encodings, like Wav2Vec. We showcase four applications: (a) forced alignment of audio text using MFCCs, time-stamping transcripts, and speaker information; (b) speech characterization using LLDs; (c) custom-made classification models with audio embeddings and MFCCs; and (d) emotional recognition models using Wav2Vec for classification of discrete emotions and their valence-arousal dominance. We provide explanations to help understand how these features can be applied for different political research questions and advice on vigilance to naive interpretation, for both experienced researchers and those who want to start working with audio.",

Simulation-based pedagogy can foster deep student engagement while developing strong peer relationships, encouraging empathy, and improving professional skills. There are many ways, however, to conduct simulations in political science courses. We argue that open-ended, multi-week simulations in which students participate as relative equals may be especially beneficial for effective learning. Although this “sandbox”-style approach to simulation learning is portable to other settings, we have used it in legislative politics courses focused on the US Senate. Drawing from our experiences and student reviews, we argue that simulations in which students can immerse themselves in a role for an extended period, focus on issues they care about, and learn from their mistakes and successes along the way create a uniquely valuable learning experience. Our approach can present challenges for instructors, but we believe it is flexible enough to be deployed in a variety of institutional settings and that any trade-offs are more than worth it.",

          "abstract": "As a racialized group that is subject to discrimination, US Latinxs are often considered “natural” coalitional partners for Black-led civil rights struggles. Although the BLM movement may serve as a potential site for cross-racial coalition building because both Latinxs and Blacks suffer from racial profiling by law enforcement, the development of a shared status across group boundaries hinges on the interpretation by Latinxs of both their personal- and group-level discrimination experiences. Using the 2020 CMPS, I explore how multiple dimensions of Latinx racial group consciousness (perceptions of discrimination, intra- and intergroup commonality, and racial identity) shape their cross-racial alliances with Black social movements. Results from multivariate analysis show that Latinxs who acknowledge Black Americans’ continued struggle against racial discrimination in both American society and the Latinx community are positively oriented toward the BLM movement. Findings also reveal contrasting effects for inter- and intragroup commonality: the former is strongly and consistently predictive of increased support for the BLM Movement, whereas the latter is associated with decreased support. These findings underscore both the opportunities and challenges for Latinx–Black political coalition building.",

          "authors": "Rosanna Nagtegaal, Machiel van der Heijden, Noortje de Boer, Lars Tummers",
          "abstract": "This study investigates whether reducing administrative burdens can increase interest in active labor market programs among job-seeking women. Employing a user-centered approach, the research is divided into two phases. In phase 1, we conducted interviews with women and a focus group with service providers to identify relevant barriers for take-up. The qualitative data showed that learning costs were the most prominent barrier, which could be further differentiated into three specific types: learning about program existence, the specific services offered, and the eligibility criteria. In phase 2, we test whether reducing these three components of learning costs increases program interest. We conduct an online quasi-experimental platform study (N = 75,451), in collaboration with a service provider, in which we adapt advertisements to inform citizens about (a) the specific services offered and (b) the eligibility criteria. A logistic regression shows that the interventions (a and b) attract more people to active labor market programs. Although women are overall more likely to click on the ads, we do not find a differential treatment effect by gender. The findings contribute to the literature by highlighting the importance of distinguishing among different types of learning costs in administrative burden interventions. Moreover, the article shows how a user-centered design can be utilized to design meaningful interventions.",

          "abstract": "Cities play an increasingly important role in international relations and are indispensable in solving global challenges. In this context, the authors have been wondering to what extent they can interact autonomously on the international stage, and what tools do national governments use to shape and control their actions? This paper uses the meta-governance approach to examine intergovernmental relations in the context of cities’ international relations. The authors reveal that states mostly rely on a full range of hands-off tools rather than hands-on ones. Attempts to hierarchically regulate cities’ international relations are limited and depend on the country’s context. Furthermore, the authors reveal that informational tools play a dominant role in intergovernmental relations and are rarely the result of strategic policy structuring by the state government. These findings have important implications for future efforts to address the multi-level governance approach in the context of cities’ international cooperation.",

While existing studies suggest Native Americans have lower trust in the federal government and higher trust in tribal governments, they often overlook the individual factors shaping this trust especially as many Native Americans no longer live on or near reservations. Using data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Political Survey, this study explores how institutional and cultural factors influence trust in both governments. The findings indicate that institutional factors, such as the national economy and external political efficacy, are positively linked to trust in both the federal and tribal governments, with stronger effects observed for the federal government. In contrast, cultural factors like linked fate and tribal involvement are positively associated with only trust in tribal government.",

But how can large numbers of public contributions be processed into interpretable and actionable information outputs? As theorists and practitioners increasingly call for participatory institutions to operate at larger scales, often enabled by new technologies, this challenge only becomes more important. This article reviews recent work on participatory institutions in order to develop several insights: ( a ) that there are different types of information that policymakers may aim to learn and that are relevant to different policy stages; ( b ) that information must be effectively processed in order to be interpretable and actionable for policymakers; ( c ) that there are different types of information processing, depending on the specificity and novelty of the information outputs that policymakers aim to learn; and ( d ) that there are different ways in which this processing can be delegated, whether to experts, ordinary people, or automated algorithms. Better recognizing these differences will help both researchers and practitioners better understand the potential and the limitations of participatory institutions in different settings and with different goals.",

Scholars have found, at best, a weakly positive correlation between democracy and environment, with little support for the proposed democratic environmental Kuznets curve, a finding we confirm with new data. We argue that democracy is too coarse a category to capture variation in environmental outcomes. Therefore, the second part of the review surveys how specific institutional features structure principal–agent relationships between citizens, leaders, and organized groups. We show that effective environmental governance depends on institutions that align incentives, reduce informational asymmetries, and match temporal horizons. These can arise in democracies but can also, under certain conditions, appear in autocratic contexts such as China, where state capacity and political incentives have aligned to produce targeted improvements. We conclude by identifying key open questions and promising directions for future research.",

However, most studies have been conducted in the US, where low turnout and high partisanship create optimal conditions for such a strategy. In this study, we analyze novel data on political parties’ use of targeting in Facebook and Instagram ads to examine the nature of microtargeting. The context of the 2022 Danish general election - with multiple parties, high voter turnout, and low partisanship - is a hard case for the mobilization thesis. Yet, in line with existing literature, we find that political parties focus their online targeting strategies on existing voters. However, the findings also suggest that political parties adjust their messages to conform with the presumed preferences of the targeted group, highlighting heterogeneity in the mobilization strategy.",

Answering this question, the paper serves a dual purpose within this special issue of Party Politics : (i) introducing the PolDem election dataset used throughout the issue, and (ii) analyzing its convergence with the widely used Manifesto Project data. The newly released PolDem dataset, based on a relational content analysis of newspaper articles published during national election campaigns, covers 15 European countries and 111 campaigns. Focusing on four broad issue domains (economic, cultural, European integration, and political issues) across countries from Northwestern, Southern, and Central-Eastern Europe, the results demonstrate strong convergence in issue positions, except for in political issues related to democracy and corruption. However, the datasets differ significantly in issue salience, especially for less salient, noneconomic issues, niche parties and in less polarized contexts.",

Using data from the 2024 American National Election Study (ANES, n = 4256), we find more evidence that operational liberals are positively associated with NVP regardless of trust, whereas distrusting operational conservatives, in particular, are associated with greater NVP. Panel data from the 2020–2024 ANES ( n = 1857) further reveal that prior liberal operational ideology is positively associated with subsequent trust in elections and NVP. Together, our findings contribute to existing literature by demonstrating ideological heterogeneity in trust in elections, NVP, and the relationship between the two. Should these patterns continue, a central challenge of preserving democratic processes may be less about the inherent value of trust and participation, and more about under which conditions these factors signal broader democratic health.",

          "abstract": "Is the mainstream news coverage of politics contributing to the legitimization and normalization of the radical right? To answer this question, we focus on two countries (Portugal and Spain) where Radical Right Parties (RRPs) emerged late and developed very quickly. A longitudinal dataset (2015–2024) of newspaper articles was employed to assess the salience of VOX and Chega , their leaders, and four core issues of the radical-right, before and after they first entered the national parliament. A major theoretical expectation was that parliamentary entrance might bolster the media salience of these parties and their leaders vis-à-vis other new political parties. While we find that Chega does indeed receive more media attention than other comparable parties, especially during election times, no such pattern can be detected for VOX. Concerning attention given to leaders, measured as salience and personalization index, we confirm that André Ventura, leader of Chega is given disproportionate attention, while that is not the case for VOX’s Santiago Abascal. Concerning issues, our findings indicate that although notable cross-national differences in media coverage persist, several key issues were already prominent before 2019 (consistent with the agenda-setting expectation) and may have helped advance the radical-right agenda in both Portugal and Spain.",

          "abstract": "We examine how the degree of social closure among political elites shapes mass-level political trust in Latin America, a region marked by historically closed elites and persistently low trust. Building on contrasting perspectives, we argue that elite closure undermines citizens’ trust, but its influence also depends on a country’s long-term patterns of closure. In contexts where elites have been highly closed over time, further increases are expected to erode trust. In more open systems, by contrast, closure may be positively associated. Our analysis combines LAPOP data (2004–2018) with PELA-USAL elite indicators in a large-N comparative framework. Estimates from hierarchical models indicate that elite closure—characterized by legislative re-election rates and family ties in politics—significantly reduces political trust. However, these results are heterogeneous: rising closure erodes trust only in countries where elites have historically been highly closed, highlighting the context-dependent role of elite composition in shaping citizens’ political trust.",

Developing countries like India rejected domestically financed mitigation efforts. Yet, from 2007 until 2008, the Indian government rapidly shifted its stance and surprisingly adopted a national climate action plan in 2008. How can we explain rapidly changing norm interpretations of a target-state in the context of international negotiations and domestic politics? I argue that norm socialisation and localisation have limitations to explain this outcome. Building upon sociological work on glocalization, insights from norm translation, and rooted in the methodology of scientific realism, I develop ‘norm glocalization’, which captures the dynamics between proactive domestic and external actors. Their interactions result in glocalized norm interpretations, representing the fusion of external and domestic actors’ preexisting norm interpretations. Applying this framework allows me to explain the emergence of India’s special approach, which is based on developmental goals that produce mitigation co-benefits.",

While it is increasingly acknowledged that populism operates across geographical scales from the local to the transnational, a systematic framework for analysing how populism functions across these scales remains lacking. Moreover, space and spatial identities have often been treated as explanatory variables for populist success, rather than as categories actively constructed and politicised through populist discourse. This article proposes a discourse-theoretical framework for studying the populist politicisation of space. Introducing the concept of spatial political logics and systematising the existing research on populism through that lens, it identifies five key spatial political logics that structure the populist politicisation of space: lower scale/higher scale, centre/periphery, North/South and East/West, in/out, and rooted/rootless. It also develops an analytical framework for future research on the intricate relations between populism and space across geographical scales, setting out key questions that can guide case studies, comparative research, and broader theoretical reflections.",

          "authors": "David Walewijns, Michel Walrave, Wannes Heirman, Heidi Vandebosch",
          "abstract": "As virtual reality (VR) evolves as a narrative medium, its capacity to immerse users in realistic environments has attracted scholarly interest. This study investigates how users perceive realism in VR beyond sensory fidelity. Using 27 interviews and four focus groups with experts and non-experts (n = 77), we examine how realism in VR is conceptualized and experienced. Qualitative analysis identified 12 factors contributing to perceived realism, grouped into five overarching dimensions: immersion, presence, embodiment, involvement and external realism. Our findings indicate that realism is shaped not only by technological features such as graphical quality but also by factors such as emotional involvement, narrative consistency and perceived authenticity. The study advances theorizing on perceived realism by proposing a framework that integrates technological and experiential dimensions and offers a basis for developing scales to measure realism in VR. Current findings are also relevant for the responsible use of VR in persuasive contexts.",

          "abstract": "In today’s digital landscape, platforms increasingly “feel like” social media. We observe the “social media-fication” of so-called “non-social media” platforms as expressive characteristics of traditional social media platforms are incorporated into mobile apps typically used for other purposes. We argue that this manifests through the repackaging of user behavioral data into expressive social updates, such as GPS maps capturing user movement or the personalized data visualizations of Spotify Wrapped. To examine this phenomenon, we completed platform walkthroughs for three apps: fitness tracking app Strava, payment app Venmo, and music streaming app Spotify. We theorize the concentration and intensification of datafication as a process that we term hyperdatafication. Hyperdatafication emerges through the repurposing of “backend” user data into socially mobilizable data representations, which encourage and further platform engagement within the sociotechnical landscape of affective capitalism. Ultimately, this study raises questions about self-tracking, commodification, and platformed sociality beyond social media.",

          "abstract": "Repetitive online communication is often labelled a ‘bot problem’ by platforms, policymakers and users. However, repetitive posting does not exclusively indicate automation; humans also engage in bot-like posting for various purposes. We adopt the term ‘botting’ to describe repetitive posting enacted through manual, semi-automated, or fully automated means. While emerging research has linked manual botting practices to commercial or fame-seeking motivations, we extend this scholarship by examining botting on Reddit – a pseudonymous platform that lacks the affordances typically associated with monetisation or personal branding. Through a mixed-methods analysis, we examine a case study in which mass-scale, repetitive posting of the mushroom emoji emerged as ‘in-group’ behaviour within Reddit’s participatory culture, prompting a performative counterpublic response. Our findings challenge the binary between human and automated posting, and underscore the importance of situating research on AI-generated and automated content within the cultural and contextual frameworks that shape its production and reception.",

Drawing on qualitative interviews with theatre professionals in Norway and ethnographic observations in Oslo, London and New York, the study demonstrates how social norms surrounding smartphone use are negotiated in different cultural contexts. The analysis highlights key tensions and dilemmas: audiences balance personal documentation with collective immersion, managers weigh promotional visibility against aesthetic disruption and performers experience interruptions that alter the sensory and affective dynamics of liveness. Extending Fischer-Lichte’s concept of the autopoietic feedback loop, the article proposes the concept of a ‘hybrid feedback loop’, in which audience responses circulate simultaneously through embodied co-presence and digitally mediated attention. This theoretical reframing captures how digital devices reconfigure the ecology of performance, reshaping how liveness is produced, perceived and policed in contemporary cultural institutions.",

          "abstract": "Dating apps employ gamified structures (e.g., swipes, likes, matches) that reshape dating scripts by blending game-like elements into social interactions. This study explores users’ conceptualization of gamification, its impact on experiences, and dating scripts. Thirty-one semi-structured interviews (17 cisgender women, 14 cisgender men) were conducted in Portugal. Participants were current and former users with different sexual orientations and a diverse age range (18–34 years old), and predominantly Portuguese. The thematic analysis presented how users likened their dating app interactions to games, identifying specific gamified features, and describing their adaptation and engagement in strategic practices to enhance appeal. Despite the uniform platform system and rules, traditional gender scripts endure and dictate a binary dynamic where men are seen as initiators and women as selectors. The findings reveal tensions between gamification’s homogenizing effect and enduring socio-cultural scripts, illustrating how platform design affordances and social norms structure dating experiences.",

          "abstract": "This article reports findings from the first study to investigate smartphone sharing in intimate relationships in Australia. Efforts to strengthen cybersecurity have been hindered by a lack of knowledge about the prevalence and dynamics of smartphone sharing, resulting in blind spots in cybersecurity design and policy. Based on a survey of 967 Australian adults who use smartphones and have been in an intimate relationship, we found that 70% share access to their mobile phones with their intimate partners. This high rate of shared access indicates that one-user, one-device threat models are inadequate for promoting cybersecurity in realistic use conditions. Such models are particularly ill-suited to intimate relationship contexts where the parties are more likely to share devices than not. Our findings provide previously unavailable baseline information about mainstream smartphone-sharing practices. This evidence can be used to improve privacy protections for telecommunications users in Australia and elsewhere.",

We examined the topics, prevalence of different moralities and how these moralities explain talk of collective action for different ideological groups. Across all issues and ideological groups, talk of action was most often associated with talk of authority but ideological differences between left- and right-leaning participants emerged. Among left-leaning people, action was motivated by a range of moral foundations, but among right-leaning people action was primarily motivated by authority. Our findings map the ideological diversity found within modern town halls and confirm the critical role of these settings in contemporary socio-political life.",

          "abstract": "In the digital age, philanthropy is increasingly mediated by platform microcelebrities who mobilize audiences for social good. This study examines the novel philanthropic model of YouTube creator Jimmy Donaldson as a case of outsourced activism , characterized by a dual-outsourcing structure: audiences transfer charitable intent and contributions (via attention-as-currency) to Donaldson, who acts as a central agent and then outsources execution to NGOs and collaborators. Using a mixed-methods design combining a walkthrough, multimodal discourse analysis of 101 videos, and topic modeling of 11,208 comments, we demonstrate how sentimental and digital spectacles sustain this process as tools for activism. The mechanism forms a new connective practice, creating a network of moral delegation and affective investment among audiences, creators, sponsors, and NGOs. Yet, it raises ethical concerns, including depoliticizing social issues and reinforcing unequal power relations. The study advances theories of media activism, connective action, and digital philanthropy by identifying a replicable logic that redefines agency, accountability, and civic participation in platform societies.",

Through a qualitative thematic analysis of 67 TikTok videos created by adolescent survivors of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the study explores how platform-specific affordances—viral trends, POV storytelling, dark humor, and digital memorialization—shape trauma narratives. Findings reveal that TikTok enables young survivors to renegotiate their post-captivity identities through participatory storytelling, humor as a coping mechanism, and the integration of personal grief into collective digital memory. The study situates these practices within theories of trauma representation, adolescent identity development, and Goffman’s dramaturgical model, illustrating how TikTok serves as both a space for self-expression and a site of performative meaning-making. By bridging digital media studies with trauma psychology, this research highlights the evolving role of social media in shaping adolescent resilience and identity reconstruction.",

          "abstract": "This study reframes late-night smartphone use among Chinese young adults beyond pathologizing it as self-regulation failure. Integrating self-determination theory with social acceleration theory, we conceptualize this behavior as a strategic temporal negotiation to reclaim personal time. Structural equation modeling (n = 503) reveals that perceived leisure freedom and leisure satisfaction primarily drive behavioral intention, while perceived short-term risk deters it. Perceived long-term risk and guilt show no significant impact on intention. Perceived time constraint intensifies actual behavior, while social control paradoxically reinforces rather than limits it. Although self-control significantly reduces behavioral enactment, it cannot eliminate underlying motivational drivers. These findings reveal a tripartite negotiation: leisure benefits versus health risks, pleasure versus guilt, and personal autonomy versus social order. We theorize this as “strategic connected deceleration”—an adaptive response whereby individuals use technology to secure autonomous time amid systemic acceleration. Interventions should address structural time pressure rather than exclusively targeting individual discipline.",

While scholarship on user resistance is growing, insufficient studies theorise such ‘invisible’ behaviours. This article develops James C. Scott’s notion of ‘infrapolitics’ to conceptualise users’ mundane tactics of resisting algorithmic power (surveillance capitalism and political censorship). Employing a video diary–interview study of Douyin users, we analyse three interrelated dimensions of infrapolitical algorithmic resistance: reflexivity (the recognition of one’s own actions as resistance based on the parallel process of developing self-understanding and awareness of algorithms), tactical immanence (using technological features for alternative purposes while still operating within platform logics) and identity-based (resisting profiling through multi-account practices and the enactment of various selves). We show that infrapolitical resistance emerges through everyday engagement with algorithms, evolving from sidestepping mismatched recommendations to subtly, reflexively and culturally situated practice that challenges the power structures embedded in algorithmic governance.",

Through multimodal analysis, this study documents the semiotic strategies involved in emotional transcoding, revealing systematic patterns for visually encoding auditory emotional expressions. Using qualitative content analysis of 1000 GIFs, this study identifies the visual techniques used in cross-modal conversion and analyzes the demographic patterns among performers who represent these expressions. The findings reveal how emotional transcoding operates through specific representational conventions and highlight questions about whose bodies become available as vehicles for emotional communication in digital platforms.",

Studies emphasize the importance of state support for domestic R&amp;D, but in frontier technology sectors, even when firms innovate, they may struggle to reach the market if they fail to navigate regulatory barriers across various stages of the value chain. Thus, we must reconsider the relationship between upgrading and commercialization, examining how regulation affecting various links in the chain can either constrain competitiveness or, in some cases, create opportunities for late developers. Focusing upon the South Korean pharmaceuticals industry, this article argues that one crucial way the state can support domestic firms today is to pursue a strategy of regulatory upgrading, helping firms navigate what I term the global regulatory chain, which spans national borders and impacts all stages of the production process and market entry.",

Our research indicates that this development is neither entirely state-led nor market-driven; rather, it relies on the collaborative actions of both the state and the industry. These actions manifest in a network-based production system composed of small- and medium-sized firms. Our study also demonstrates that this governance system necessitates a pre-existing interdependent relationship between the state and industry. Our work broadens the prevailing state-led approach to industrial development in East Asia, offering an alternative perspective that frames the efforts of the state and private entities as concurrent rather than competing explanations.",

This study complicates this view and argues that the valuation process is a struggle for ownership, deepening inequalities within the venture capital sector. Drawing on interviews with 19 early-stage VCs in London, I show that VC funds’ ability to obtain ownership stakes has changed in the low interest, expansive monetary policy environment of the 2010s. Late-stage VC funds moved into early-stage investing, increasing competition and upsetting previous alignments. Valuation practices centred on obtaining ownership and led to an antagonistic relationship between early and late-stage VCs. Following this, only a small group of elite funds delivered outsized returns while most funds failed to deliver promised returns. By foregrounding material limitations and conflict in the making of valuations, this study suggests that the business model of many VC funds became increasingly embattled during the 2010s tech boom.",

To that end, we collected data on the authors who submit their manuscripts to GEP, those who publish in GEP, and the many scholars who review for GEP. Using this information, we evaluate trends over time, particularly in terms of collaboration and diversity. We find that coauthorship has become much more common in recent years, with many early-career scholars publishing in teams. Gender balance among authors has improved considerably over the last quarter century, and people who engage with the journal are diverse in the theoretical and methodological approaches they bring to bear on global environmental politics. However, as most authors work at universities in North America and Europe, geographic diversity remains low, resulting in a lack of representation from the Global South. We end by introducing the articles included in this twenty-fifth anniversary special issue, all of which look to the journal’s past to derive lessons for our collective future.",

          "authors": "D. G. Webster",
          "abstract": "As we celebrate twenty-five years of Global Environmental Politics, this article reviews major trends in the journal. Results are organized around the three main areas of scope: global, environmental, and political. The global scope expanded somewhat, but the largest change was the deepening of scholarship across levels of analysis. The environmental scope is now dominated by climate change, which crowded out other issues but also created a critical mass of knowledge that helped advance the field. The political scope started with emphasis on systemic drivers of environmental degradation but then quickly shifted to the design and implementation of specific institutions. This detailed research created a mountain of evidence to show that, while rules and norms can make a difference, their effectiveness is constrained by disconnects between actors who have the power to govern the environment and those who have the incentives to do so. Scholars who recognize this trend are returning to the journal’s roots, emphasizing empowerment as a method to address systemic barriers to effective environmental governance and thereby get closer to a future that is just and sustainable.",

          "authors": "Moli Gu, Shuangshuang Tang, Liyue Lin",
          "abstract": "Rural migrant women in China face dual structural constraints stemming from gender norms and the household registration ( hukou ) system during the urban settlement process. However, the influence of shifts in gender role attitudes on settlement intentions remains insufficiently examined. Drawing on survey data collected in Nanjing, this study employs binary logistic regression and moderation analyses to examine the associations between attitudinal shifts and both long‐term residence intentions and hukou transfer intentions. The findings reveal a general trend towards the modernization of gender role attitudes among rural migrant women in urban contexts, alongside stronger hukou transfer intentions than long‐term residence intentions. Compared with women whose gender role attitudes have regressed, those whose attitudes remain stable exhibit significantly higher levels of both long‐term residence and hukou transfer intentions, while progressive shifts in gender role attitudes are associated with a greater propensity to express hukou transfer intentions. Moreover, social embeddedness and relational networks moderate the relationship between shifts in gender role attitudes and hukou transfer intentions. These results highlight the importance of promoting the modernization of gender role attitudes, reducing institutional barriers to integration and alleviating family caregiving burdens as essential strategies for enhancing the settlement intentions of rural migrant women.",

          "authors": "Andrea Pelliccia",
          "abstract": "This article explores the social transformation of Rome's Banglatown, located in the Torpignattara neighbourhood, as a case of everyday interculturalism. Through ethnographic fieldwork with the Bangladeshi diaspora, it examines how diversity is lived, negotiated and reconfigured in the spaces of daily interaction. Building on the concept of ‘commonplace diversity’, the study highlights how routine public encounters—especially in schools, parks and local commerce—foster recognition and coexistence, while often stopping short of deeper intercultural intimacy. The analysis reveals a gendered dynamic in which Bangladeshi women, particularly mothers, act as informal socio‐cultural brokers in the public sphere, while men remain largely confined to ethnic networks. Crucially, by introducing the notion of relational hybridization , the article demonstrates that second‐generation children are more likely to shift intercultural relations into the private and affective sphere, cultivating friendships and emotional proximity across ethnic lines. These practices do not merely intensify existing ties but alter the social meaning of difference by relocating interculturality into domains of intimacy. These children generate hybrid forms of belonging that challenge both community conservatism and societal exclusion. The article argues that Banglatown is not simply a site of demographic concentration, but a relational space where diversity is enacted and reshaped from below. It contributes to contemporary debates on urban interculturalism by foregrounding affective infrastructures, generational shifts and the everyday labour of living with difference.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the settlement intentions of female migrants is crucial for promoting inclusive and sustainable urbanization, yet existing studies often lack a gender‐sensitive and multi‐level analytical framework. Drawing on ecological systems theory, this study integrates spatial analysis and interpretable machine learning to examine the spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of female migrants' settlement intentions in China. Results show that settlement intentions are unevenly distributed, with northern and northwestern regions showing higher intentions than southern regions. The meso‐system (workplace and family context) exerts the most pronounced influence on settlement decisions. Short‐distance migration and higher local minimum wages consistently strengthen women's willingness to settle. By contrast, accumulated household difficulties and elevated crime levels substantially weaken settlement intentions. Notably, several influences are nonlinear: moderate working hours enhance settlement willingness, but excessive hours quickly erode it, and air pollution becomes a decisive deterrent once the AQI exceeds 100. These findings suggest that female migrants' settlement decisions emerge from the balance between economic security, family sustainability, and urban livability, underscoring the need for gender‐sensitive and place‐based policy interventions.",

It argues that not only was she remarkably ahead of her time in identifying and naming this important new phenomenon over 60 years ago, but that her discussion of the social and housing market impacts of gentrification have proved to be remarkably prescient. Although gentrification has taken many new forms which she could not have anticipated, she located gentrification as a process of social class and housing change which has subsequently transformed the physical and social structure of London and many other major cities. The paper examines her writing from 1964, 1973 and 1989 and highlights its continuing relevance in the context of the subsequent social and housing market changes in London and other cities.",

          "abstract": "This study contributes to the literature on environmental influences on individual life satisfaction in older age, by offering novel empirical evidence from Italy, a country marked by rapid population ageing, a difficult homeownership regime and pronounced territorial inequalities. We jointly investigate various aspects of the living environment, both the indoor characteristics of the housing—its stability, adequacy and affordability—and the outdoor features of the immediate neighbourhood environment—its liveability and accessibility. We offer evidence that housing adequacy, friendliness of the neighbourhood environment and accessibility to public services are the most relevant aspects for older Italians' life satisfaction. Nevertheless, various aspects of the living environment proved to be important, highlighting the importance of adopting a multidimensional and integrated approach. In addition, despite well‐known North–South differences in Italy, we did not find substantial variations across Italian macro‐areas in this link. Conversely, the city type of residence does appear to matter, underscoring the need to conduct territorial analyses at a finer spatial scale that surpasses the traditional North–South divide. By placing our analysis within the literature on environmental effects on ageing, this study provides empirical evidence that can inform policy about interventions to enhance housing and neighbourhood conditions for elderly individuals, promoting friendly communities and well‐designed urban spaces to support active ageing.",

In response, the Government of Canada is exploring policy options for stricter supply chain regulations, including legislative measures such as the recently passed Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act (Bill S‐211). We assess the Canadian coffee sector's capacity to comply with current and potential legislation by conducting a public policy review alongside an analysis of corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports. Companies' commitments are ranked based on adherence to standards, internal policies, and the presence of external audits or third‐party verification. Our findings reveal that while many companies are building capacity to manage supply chain risks, their preparedness varies. These results emphasize the limitations of voluntary commitments and support the need for comprehensive mandatory due diligence legislation to align corporate practices with international environmental and human rights standards.",

This support can take many forms, including providing aid ( in situ ) or accepting immigrants ( ex situ ). Focusing on the Netherlands, a generous climate aid provider with a high share of immigrant population, we explore how domestic support for an overseas adaptation policy package is influenced by levels of migration and aid directed at Global South countries that vary in their location, as well as economic links with and policy proximity to the Netherlands. Using an online forced-choice conjoint experiment, we asked Dutch respondents ( n = 1199) to compare two policy packages. We find that respondents support policy packages with: (1) lower numbers of immigrants, (2) lower volumes of aid, and (3) migrants from countries in geographical proximity (Albania) and shared religion (Colombia), but not Pakistan and Somalia. Moreover, they support countries that (4) import from the Netherlands and (5) have pledged to become climate-neutral earlier, a policy priority for the Netherlands.",

          "authors": "Preeya Mohan",
          "abstract": "Recent research underscores the disproportionate burden of climate change on developing countries, often exacerbated by historical debt. The escalating debt crisis can hinder investments in climate adaptation and mitigation, while climate‐related disasters can further exacerbate debt burdens. By delving into the complex interplay between debt and climate change, this paper explores their historical intersection, examining how these interconnected issues have shaped global inequalities. It delves into the literature on the historical context of debt accumulation in developing countries, the role of international financial institutions, and subsequent efforts to address debt burdens. The concept of “climate debt”—the notion that developed nations bear a responsibility to developing countries for their historical emissions—is critically assessed. The paper further evaluates the potential of debt relief as a mechanism for achieving climate justice, enabling developing countries to redirect financial resources towards climate‐resilient development and address the enduring legacies of colonialism and unequal development. Finally, through case studies of debt relief programs, the paper explores their implications for climate action, focusing on their capacity to contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future. The paper makes a key contribution to a more informed discourse on how debt relief can be used to address climate change, offering practical insights for policymakers and researchers. It provides a crucial foundation for developing strategies that promote climate justice and foster a more equitable and sustainable future.

          "authors": "Milena Büchs, Vera Trappmann, Gina Moran, Max Koch",
          "abstract": "Given that the climate emergency is accelerating, transformative climate action becomes increasingly urgent. Considering social and fairness implications of climate action is critical to avoid widening inequalities and public opposition. The just transitions (JT) and sustainable welfare/eco‐social policy (SW/ESP) literatures both address social and fairness issues related to climate action. However, they have developed largely separately from each other and are not well integrated, limiting the capacity to holistically consider social and fairness issues in climate action. To examine differences and synergies between these two bodies of literature, this paper compares their stances on key themes of capitalism and economic growth, work and welfare, and global justice. While both of these literatures are internally diverse, JT publications tend to focus on justice implications for workers in high carbon sectors, and SW/ESP research examines how welfare systems can support wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries. The JT literature would benefit from a more systematic consideration of post‐capitalist and post‐growth debates, which are more prevalent in the SW/ESP literature, including options for decoupling welfare from work and from economic growth. The JT literature increasingly discusses issues on global justice and decolonization, but the SW/ESP literature has so far largely failed to examine these themes, a gap that it should address. Overall, we argue that each of the literatures can integrate aspects from the other to form a more holistic and transformative approach for addressing social and fairness issues in climate policy.

          "authors": "Eungjoon Kim",
          "abstract": "This study explores how predictive artificial intelligence (AI) becomes institutionalized in public administration, using a wildfire risk‐prediction system implemented by a Korean forestry agency as a case. Moving beyond technical performance, the study conceptualizes predictive AI as a dynamic policy instrument that reshapes administrative routines, authority, and accountability. Drawing on Scott's institutional theory, Salamon's policy‐instrument framework, and Ziewitz's algorithmic governance model, it employs a mixed‐methods design combining surveys and semi‐structured interviews with frontline officials. The findings reveal three insights. First, predictive AI influences decision‐making by offering real‐time quantitative justification, especially in field‐level operations. Second, successful institutionalization depends on the alignment of regulatory (e.g., SOPs), normative (e.g., leadership support), and cognitive (e.g., trust) pillars. Third, organizational context—such as agency size and leadership orientation—mediates how these factors interact. Despite high technical accuracy, institutionalization remains uneven due to unclear accountability and weak integration mechanisms. The study identifies a structural tension between AI‐driven efficiency and traditional accountability norms. Theoretically, it bridges policy‐instrument theory and algorithmic governance within an institutional framework. Practically, it proposes design principles for responsible AI implementation in government. While focused on wildfire management, the framework is transferable to other predictive technologies in public administration.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) have become widely used tools that provide personalized political information to help voters make informed choices and strengthen democratic processes. However, little research has examined their potential unintended effects. This article analyzes data from a follow‐up survey of the VAA Voteswiper during the 2025 German federal election campaign to assess whether VAA results align with users' prior voting intentions and how they correlate with subsequent short‐term voting intentions. We find that users intending to vote for fringe parties are most likely to receive a VAA match consistent with their initial preferences. In contrast, those initially favoring more centrist parties are less likely to receive a match with their preferred party and more often match with populist or fringe parties—particularly the far‐right Alternative for Germany. Moreover, we identify substantial differences across social groups in both the alignment between VAA results and prior preferences and the extent to which VAA results influence intended short‐term vote choices. These findings suggest that VAAs may disproportionately benefit populist parties, especially on the radical right, potentially shifting user preferences and challenging the widely held view of VAAs as neutral tools of political education.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the development and consolidation of Uruguay's national digital agenda as a policy instrument and the normative preferences underlying this choice. It traces its roots in the post‐World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) era. Using the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) methodology, the research assesses the Uruguayan government's attention across 20 policy sectors and over 200 subtopics from 2007 to 2025. The analysis identifies three phases of digital agenda evolution: institutionalization (2007–2010), expansion (2011–2015), and consolidation (2016–2025), reflecting the country's adaptive strategies and alignment with international norms. Uruguay's digital agenda stands out as an uninterrupted instrument in Latin America, reflecting state preferences for digital inclusion, a digital welfare state and an alignment with the liberal international and regional order of internet governance. This continuity underscores the role of national agencies in institutionalizing digital policies. Through extensive document analysis, this case study provides insights into national digital agendas as tools for embedding state‐led normative preferences and sharing preferences with similar regional instruments, both within eLAC and the EU. Empirically the study contributes to internet policy literature by examining the role of national digital agendas in shaping multilevel governance, assessing horizontal policy instruments and advancing a digital welfare state framework.",

          "authors": "Gordon B. Dahl, Joseph Engelberg, Runjing Lu, William Mullins",
          "abstract": "We estimate that 3.1 percent of US voters, or 6.1 million individuals, were registered to vote in two states in 2020, opening up the possibility for them to choose where to vote. Double registrants are concentrated in the wealthiest zip codes and respond to both incentives and costs, disproportionately choosing to vote in swing states (higher incentive) and states that automatically send out mail-in ballots (lower cost). We call this behavior Cross-State Strategic Voting. While others have documented strategic incentives on who to vote for, this paper is the first to consider strategic incentives on where to vote.

          "abstract": "What is the effect of politicians’ wages on corruption in the presence of criminal groups that use both bribes and violence? With a regression discontinuity design and three distinct proxies for corruption, we show that better-paid Italian politicians are more likely to promote transparency and competition in procurement but also more likely to incur criminal attacks. The effects of wages, which subside after three years, are driven by changes in incumbents’ behavior rather than improved selection. These findings show how higher wages may curb corruption, but also foster the use of violence as an alternative tool to influence policymaking. (JEL D72, D73, J31, K42)",

          "abstract": "As cybercriminals increasingly target health care, hospitals face the growing threat of ransomware attacks. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that prevents users from accessing electronic systems and demands a ransom to restore access. We create and link a database of hospital ransomware attacks to Medicare claims data. We quantify the effects of ransomware attacks on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Ransomware attacks decrease hospital volume by 17–24 percent during the initial attack week, with recovery occurring within 3 weeks. Among patients already admitted to the hospital when a ransomware attack begins, in-hospital mortality increases by 34–38 percent. (JEL D83, I12, I13, K42)",

          "abstract": "Globally, gang proliferation is fought primarily through sweeps. This paper uses a difference-in-differences strategy to examine their causal impact on crime for arrested individuals and their peers. Analysis focuses on the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, which underwent a notable policy shift. Findings reveal significant crime reductions among those arrested and their peers of 85 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Evidence suggests the first stems from incapacitation and the second from less criminal environment. A counterfactual exercise suggests that broader targeting of key players could have reduced crime by 43 percentage points more. This implies network analysis could enhance policy formulation.

Despite the availability of effective treatments, including services (e.g., psychotherapy) and drugs (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics), this paper documents substantial geographic variation in treatment utilization rates among Medicare enrollees. Exploiting patient migration, I show that 45.8 percent of service utilization variation is attributable to place-specific factors, compared to 15.1 percent for drug utilization. Further analyses suggest the role of provider accessibility in explaining the different place effects between service and drug use. Regarding health outcomes, I find that higher treatment utilization is associated with lower risks of self-harm-related emergency department visits. (JEL H75, I12, I13, I18)",

I use multiple quasi-experimental research designs to examine firms in the United Kingdom and find that increasing tax credit generosity substantially enhances the effect of grant funding on R&amp;D for small firms, suggesting that the instruments are complements. Financial constraints are likely at play. The effects are strongest for firms that appear constrained, and the combination of policies increases R&amp;D “entry.” Furthermore, I find that the instruments are substitutes for larger firms, which are usually less constrained. Some alternative explanations can be ruled out. (JEL D22, H25, H81, L25, O31, O38)",

Effects are two to three times higher among those closest to the polling place. When available, voters substitute to mail-in voting as distance to the polling place increases.

Parliamentarians who had supported the Vichy regime faced a two-stage purge process involving two courts. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that law graduates—an influential group with ties to one of the courts—had a 10 to 14 percentage point higher acquittal rate. We analyze 17,589 documents in individual defendants’ files to explain this difference. According to this analysis, indirect connections—connections through third parties—enabled transmission of information to the judges, highlighting how connected elite groups can navigate transitions despite institutional safeguards.

          "abstract": "In a 6-month pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT; ISRCTN16033549), we compared a just-in-time intervention to support energy management in adults with long COVID (LC) to standard care. Participants received either the ‘Pace Me’ app and a wearable activity tracker (intervention) or an app only with data entry screens (control). The intervention group received just-in-time messages on energy management when they reached 50%, 75%, and 100% of their daily ‘activity allowance’. The primary outcome was post-exertional malaise (PEM) measured by the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire-PEM (DSQ-PEM). Of 369 participants assessed for eligibility, 250 participants were randomised 1:1, and 77 controls and 84 intervention participants were included in the final per-protocol analysis. There was no time by group interaction for the DSQ-PEM. The intervention group value was 48 (95% CI 44-53) at baseline and 46 (95% CI 41-51) post-intervention (arbitrary units). The control group value was 47 (95% CI 42-52) at baseline and 44 (95% CI 39-49) at follow-up (interaction effect p = 0.614, η²p = 0.002; trivial). No individual question exhibited an interaction effect (p &gt; 0.05). Although the intervention had minimal effect compared to control, the substantial recovery rates previously reported in LC, coupled with our wide inclusion criteria may have masked intervention effects. Therefore, future studies should consider this energy management framework in conditions without such recovery rates, such as CFS.",

Using maize grain yield response to nitrogen field trials, we consider the uncertainty surrounding N rate recommendations to demonstrate that fertilizer N rates can be reduced by 12─16% in the US Corn Belt, with negligible risk of maize yield losses. This reduction in N fertilizer applications decrease N 2 O–N emissions by 10% and N leaching by 13%, leading to a social benefit of 230─$530 M, due to enhanced air and water quality. Additional N reductions could benefit ecosystems and human health. However, the high risk of yield loss associated with additional N reductions makes this practice unacceptable for farmers. This emphasizes the need for incentive programs that consider the responsibilities and limitations of all actors along the food supply chain.",

          "abstract": "Human hunter-gatherer groups were commonly thought to be broadly egalitarian, with increasingly formal hierarchical social structures hypothesized to spread following the introduction of agriculture. However, this view is being challenged by mounting evidence for social hierarchies in several foraging populations. Nonetheless, the processes by which such hierarchies emerge, and whether human hierarchies are homologous with non-human systems of dominance, remains unclear. Here we examine the role of prestige, the tendency to freely confer status and influence on skilled or esteemed individuals and a proposed component of human-unique cultural psychology, in generating unequal patterns of social influence. Through a combination of cultural evolutionary modelling, human experimentation, and evolutionary simulations, we find that human prestige psychology generates highly unequal influence hierarchies, and that the “prestige sensitivity” we measure empirically in human participants closely matches the predictions of our evolutionary simulations, suggesting it is an evolved psychological adaptation. Nonetheless, unlike non-human dominance hierarchies, the processes involved are non-coercive, being driven by individuals freely seeking high quality information. We thus conclude that social hierarchies plausibly have a deep evolutionary history in our lineage, with prestige enabling hierarchies to be mutually beneficial as opposed to coercive.",

Weak social connections are associated with adverse age-related health outcomes, but we know little about the ageing-related processes underlying this. Using data from 7047 adults aged 50+ in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we explore associations between diverse aspects of social connections and both older subjective age and accelerated physiological age using a validated physiological ageing combining cardiovascular, respiratory, haematologic and metabolic indicators. Doubly robust estimations using inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment estimators show that living alone, low social integration and low social support are risk factors for physiological age acceleration. However, weak social connections did not have a statistically significant association with older subjective age. Analyses are robust to multiple sensitivity analyses and maintained four years later. We propose the hypothesis that accelerated physiological ageing may be a mechanism underpinning the relationship between weak social connections and age-related morbitidy and mortality.",

          "abstract": "Do politicians consider the gender of party leaders when selecting coalition partners? Little is known about whether gender shapes how political elites evaluate potential coalition allies. I theorize that politicians prefer women as coalition partners for their perceived qualities, such as consensus building, trustworthiness, and governance abilities, making them a less threatening option for politicians’ aspirations. Conducting an original conjoint experiment with 979 Spanish mayors, I find that mayors, especially those on the center and left, prefer to form coalition governments with parties led by women. The analysis of the mechanisms suggests that women leaders are perceived as easier to communicate and more competent to govern. These findings suggest that gendered perceptions and stereotypes may play a role in elite decision-making and shaping coalition preferences.",

While these findings have concerning implications for democratic representation, the magnitude and sources of so-called “conservative over-estimation” are poorly understood. We show that a novel approach to measuring politicians’ perceptions—which asks politicians to draw the distribution of their constituents’ preferences, rather than provide a point estimate—clarifies the magnitude and causes of conservative over-estimation. While the vast majority of politicians exhibit a conservative bias, our “perceived-distribution” task cuts the size of this bias in half. Moreover, psychological projection counterbalances conservative over-estimation among left-wing politicians but reinforces it among right-wing politicians. Our results raise questions about existing accounts of elite misperceptions and help to identify the psychological causes of conservative over-estimation.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have shown that restrictive zoning is correlated with racial segregation, but we lack an understanding of why this occurs. I argue that the link operates through the clustering of housing costs generated by land use regulations. Using an agent-based model, I find that restrictive zoning produces racial segregation, but only when residents have homophilic preferences and unequal wealth. Then using a novel dataset of parcel-level zoning codes, I show neighborhoods that are restrictively zoned have higher home values, are less diverse, wealthier, and have more homeowners. Finally, I show that cities vary in the degree to which zoning regulations are geographically clustered. Collectively, these results indicate that land use regulations contribute to the maintenance of racial segregation across neighborhoods.",

The abrupt transition from in-person to online learning further introduced uncertainty regarding academic performance. To comprehensively assess the impacts of the pandemic on college students, this study collected longitudinal data from June 2020 to June 2021, involving 184 undergraduate students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The dataset includes demographic and socioeconomic status information of participants, measures of mental health outcomes, online student engagement, computer and Internet performance, daily activity diary, general indoor environment satisfaction, Fitbit data, sensor measured indoor environment quality, facial expression, and GPA. To our best knowledge, this dataset is also the first dataset that covers multimodal assessment of mental health outcomes, online learning, and potential influencing variables during COVID-19. Data was gathered through online surveys, video recordings, IoT indoor environmental sensors, and Fitbit wristbands.",

The surveys aimed to capture public acceptance and concerns regarding AVs, focusing on changes in perception before and after the trials. Data was gathered from representative samples in three municipalities per canton, using longitudinal panel surveys in Schaffhausen and a cross-sectional survey in Valais. Possible uses include analyses of public awareness and acceptance of AVs post-trial and investigating regional differences in perceived accessibility and benefits. This dataset offers valuable insights for researchers interested in the integration of AVs into public transport systems. The data enables further analysis and comparison with other regions and contexts.",

          "abstract": "Social media has grown to be a large part of our virtual connectedness online. However, with this growth in digital connection, we have also become connected with digital entities that run them (social media). Borrowing from the concept of interpersonal responsiveness, researchers have found that users perceive their algorithm to be responsive to their needs and sensitive to their identity have a greater sense of well-being online and media enjoyment. However, the mechanisms for which these connect with one another (responsiveness predicting subjective well-being) remain to be disentangled. Guided by self-determination theory, this study examines whether autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfaction through TikTok use mediate the associations between perceived algorithm responsiveness and insensitivity and satisfaction with life. With an online survey ( N = 385), our study found that greater responsiveness is associated with greater life satisfaction mediated through greater relatedness satisfaction. However, greater competence satisfaction was associated with lower life satisfaction. Future research and current limitations in light of our findings are discussed.",

          "authors": "Melissa Watanabe Mata",
          "abstract": "The term “Women of Color” (WoC) has seen a marked rise in usage, yet little is known about how it functions as a coalitional identity with political significance. I argue that WoC operates both as a descriptor and an identity. As a descriptor, it resembles a panethnic label for nonwhite women. When adopted as an identity—the focus of this study—it may carry deeper significance connected to its progressive roots. Scholars often categorize all racially diverse women as WoC based on presumed experiences of oppression. However, this assumption overlooks variation in race-gendered discrimination shaped by factors such as appearance and class. Women who are perceived as white or those with lighter skin tones, for example, may not experience racialization in the same ways as other nonwhite women. Given the label’s association with liberal political views and its emphasis on “color,” some women may choose not to adopt it or may be uncertain about their inclusion. Using 2020 CMPS data, this study builds on WoC scholarship by incorporating Asian women and compares their experiences and attitudes to those of Latina and Black women. Results show that the majority of Asian women identify as a WoC and report high levels of WoC-linked fate. Among Asian women, personal experiences with discrimination and empathy toward other marginalized groups are especially important in WoC identity formation. WoC-linked fate also demonstrates political relevance across all three groups, showing a positive relationship with support for undocumented immigrants and the #MeToo movement.",

          "authors": "Remus Gabriel Anghel, Lucian Vesalon",
          "abstract": "Food security is becoming increasingly problematised, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, or by the crisis in the global grain markets induced by the war in Ukraine. How out-migration and return change agriculture in different countries of origin, including Eastern Europe, is less understood in connection to such crises. In this paper we look at the ways in which agriculture and its labour regime change under the impact of international migration in two geographical areas in Romania, the Transylvanian Highlands and Banat. We analyse how two types of actors return to Romanian agriculture and how they occupy different labour positions: small-scale entrepreneurs and seasonal workers. Unlike much research on migration and development depicting migrants as agents of positive change, we consider social remittances as contested. We advance the notion of “opposing remittances” to account for how migrants differently reflect on their migration experiences and how class-based relations, marginalisation and racial inequalities affect social remittances related to labour. Ultimately, this paper reveals how inequalities are entangled in return migration in agriculture, and how contingent migration experiences contribute to the variegation of social remittances.",

          "abstract": "The racial landscape of US neighborhoods shifted tremendously over the past decade, raising questions about how these changes are reflected in local schools. This study combines school zone shapefiles with census and Civil Rights Database data to explore whether neighborhood racial change in Black populations predicts changes in Black-white school suspension disparities from 2010 to 2018. We find that racial disparities in suspensions increased, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing substantial shifts in Black populations. These increases were especially pronounced in suburban and rural areas with shifting Black populations and all predominantly White neighborhoods. Although school discipline reforms aimed to reduce racial disparities, they only declined in certain types of neighborhoods, most notably in urban areas. Our findings advance insights into processes of school and neighborhood change, school discipline, and racial stratification, with broad policy implications.",

          "abstract": "The idea that better cognitive functioning helps to close the gap between goals and behavior seems self-evident, yet empirical work has found unusually weak interindividual associations between cognitive task performance and real-world, goal-relevant outcomes. Here, we resolve this paradox by shifting from trait-level to state-level analysis. Leveraging a microtask design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students ( N = 184, time points = 9248), we show that within-person upswings in domain-general cognitive processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal setting and achievement across both academic and nonacademic domains, even controlling for other factors. A one-standard-deviation change in cognitive precision had an effect statistically equivalent to ~40 min of work, with similar or larger predictive effects compared to fluctuations in mood/motivation and no moderation by trait-level self-control or conscientiousness. Our work addresses long-standing controversies and highlights the power of intraindividual analysis to reveal relationships missed by cross-sectional approaches.",

          "abstract": "There are increasing calls for economic assistance in the form of social safety nets (SSNs) to be designed and implemented to promote women’s economic inclusion and agency, contributing to closing gender disparities globally. Here we investigate the extent to which SSNs affect women’s economic achievements and agency through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials implemented in low- and middle-income countries. We searched six databases utilizing search strings in English, French and Spanish through December 2024. Studies were assessed for risk of bias using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Our sample includes 1,307 effect sizes from 93 studies, representing 218,828 women across 45 low- and middle-income countries. Using robust variance estimation meta-analysis, we show significant overall pooled effects (Hedges’ g = 0.107, P &lt; 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.085–0.129), driven by increases in economic achievements (productive work, savings, assets and expenditures) and agency (voice, autonomy and decision-making). We find significant treatment effects for unconditional cash transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.128, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.097 to 0.159), social care services (Hedges’ g = 0.122, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.071 to 0.174), asset transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.115, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.071 to 0.160) and public work programmes (Hedges’ g = 0.127, P = 0.031, 95% CI 0.015 to 0.239). We find comparatively smaller effects for conditional cash transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.059, P = 0.019, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.108) and found no evidence of effects for in-kind transfers. SSNs can empower women economically and socially; however, limitations and evidence gaps remain, including the need for further rigorous testing of design and operational components, the role of contextual factors and cost–benefit analysis with a gender lens.",

          "abstract": "Cities play a leading role in climate change actions and solutions, yet city-level case study sources remain fragmented, biased towards large cities, and inaccessible to local practitioners, notably in the Global South. In response, the Urban Climate Change Research Network (UCCRN) is developing a City Solutions Case Study Atlas (City CSA), a centralized and searchable online platform that integrates diverse case studies focused on climate solutions with an interactive global map containing multiple data layers. The UCCRN City CSA provides an evidence base for academics, urban policymakers, city practitioners, city networks, civil society, and the financial sector to facilitate equitable knowledge transfer and support the development and implementation of context-specific, science-informed urban climate solutions. This paper presents the framework, metadata, and structure of the UCCRN City CSA and assesses metadata search filters and large language model (LLM)-assisted discourse analysis as complementary tools for three user types.",

          "abstract": "In the UK, 28 million households consume 25% of the total energy and contribute to 25% of the carbon emissions. It is vital to focus on sustainability and energy efficiency within the building sector for decarbonizing purposes. However, traditional methods such as simulations or on-site inspections are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this research, we propose a novel methodology framework for estimating building energy efficiency using only external and widely existing data. We have designed and trained an end-to-end multi-channel deep learning model utilizing high-resolution thermal infrared and optical remotely sensed images, street view images, socio-economic indicators, and building morphological data. Validated in Glasgow and Edinburgh, the model achieved F1 scores of 0.64 and 0.69. Further analyses surprisingly suggest that more deprived neighborhoods tend to have better building energy efficiency. The study highlights how widely available data and AI can provide scalable, global solutions for advancing the net-zero agenda.",

          "abstract": "Flood-induced risks increasingly disrupt interdependent infrastructure systems. However, how these risks propagate, cluster or diverge across interconnected systems is unclear. To bridge this gap, this study constructs a multi-tiered risk-weighted network to disentangle interactions and reveal risk communities. UK-wide flood events from 2003 to 2023 were simulated using CaMa-Flood. Using these simulations, a flood-specific risk resistance surface, incorporating device, spatial, and external disturbance dimensions, was used to construct an adjacency graph for 29,697 EV charging points, yielding a risk-weighted network with 192,862,650 annual edges. This integrated framework enables a unified examination of flood-driven interaction pathways across scales. We find: (1) Flood risk propagation is driven respectively by spatial amplification (63.8%) at the node level, hybrid natural–built coupling (45.3%, 49.6%) at the buffer scale, and impact-driven dynamics (49.0%, 23.6%, 27.0%) at the disturbance layer, representing the relative contributions of entropy-weighted factor groups that form each resistance layer; (2) Risk propagation is governed not by group size, but by the interplay among structural coherence, spatial buffering, and fragmentation constraints across scales; and (3) Risk propagation emerges in fragmented, outward-oriented communities, where spatial geographical interplay, rather than path length, shapes intergroup cascades. These findings highlight multi-scale structural mechanisms driving flood-induced cascade behaviour.",
