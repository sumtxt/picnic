          "authors": "KYOSUKE KIKUTA",
          "abstract": "Interstate conflict is rare not primarily because states settle disputes peacefully but largely because they have no serious dispute. To address this simple but oft-neglected reality, I provide a comprehensive measurement of states’ claimable areas. Focusing on three international norms that emerged after the world wars (territorial integrity, minority protection, and maritime sovereignty), I code geographical extents of states’ claimable areas for 1946–2024. I illustrate the usefulness of this dataset by applying it to oil and conflict. By leveraging the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills, natural experiments, and difference-in-differences, I demonstrate that fuel resources increased interstate conflicts only when discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. The extensive analyses of validity, heterogeneity, and mechanisms, as well as the “most-similar” case study, provide further evidence. These findings expand the emerging literature on territorial norms by providing comprehensive, rigorous, and contemporary evidence for claimability in international relations.",

          "authors": "Jonas Radl, William Foley, Lea Katharina Kröger, Patricia Lorente, Alberto Palacios-Abad, Heike Solga, Jan Stuhler, Madeline Swarr",
          "abstract": "Cognitive effort (i.e., the mobilization of mental resources for task performance) is essential to equality of opportunity and meritocracy because it epitomizes individual agency. However, sociological theories of social inequality in effort are scarce and partial, and available empirical measures of effort are unreliable and lack validity. We fill this lacuna by (1) elaborating a theoretical account of how socioeconomic status (SES) affects children’s cognitive effort, (2) developing a novel research design for measuring effort using simple-yet-demanding behavioral tasks and varying incentive conditions, and (3) presenting evidence based on this laboratory design featuring 1,360 5th-grade students. We theorize that greater material abundance and lower environmental threat reduce the subjective costs of exerting effort for higher-SES children, and that parental socialization emphasizing autonomy gives them more intrinsic motivation compared to lower-SES children. Conversely, we posit that the effort of lower-SES children is more susceptible to material and status rewards. Supporting our expectations, we find that social origin effects on effort are largest when incentives are absent, yet decrease notably when material incentives are introduced. Albeit surprisingly modest and malleable, social origin effects on effort challenge voluntaristic notions of individual agency. Crucially though, providing tangible performance rewards can significantly narrow socioeconomic disparities in effort.",

          "abstract": "We study a search platform ranking firms’ products across sponsored and organic positions, accounting for the incentives of both firms and consumers. To characterize an optimal ranking when the number of firms is large, we formulate a Mixing Principle for Consumer Search, adapting tools from the social learning literature. The platform assigns the products it deems best to sponsored positions and obfuscates the content of organic positions subject to consumers’ participation constraints. Obfuscation serves to maximise the platform’s revenue from both sponsored position auctions and commission fees. Our results allow us to analyse the welfare effects of sponsored positions.",

          "authors": "Philipp Hochmuth, Per Krusell, Kurt Mitman",
          "abstract": "The EU has embarked on an ambitious path toward climate neutrality. How difficult will this transition be for the population as a whole and different subsets of consumers? This paper investigates this question using a dynamic general equilibrium model that captures a key feature of energy consumption: the relative energy content in one’s consumption basket falls significantly as a function of one’s relative income. Thus, low-income consumers are expected to be hit harder by the higher energy prices that we anticipate over the next few decades. In the model, energy—a complementary input to capital and labour—can be produced either using fossil fuel or a “green” technology. We represent the EU policy in terms of a tax on fossil fuel and show that the European Commission’s Fit-for-55 package implies a 106.4% tax on the fossil-based technology. The output losses from this tax are substantial, and GDP is 6.3% lower in the new steady state. The burden falls primarily on the lowest-income agent who represents the first income quintile and is 47% more worse off than the highest-income agent representing the fifth quintile. The output losses can almost be cut in half if the economy achieves a simultaneous increase in energy efficiency as outlined in the Fit-for-55 package.",

We show that income tax systems worldwide are well approximated by a two-parameter log-linear effective tax function. We provide country- and year-specific estimates and document several insights. First, higher average tax rates are associated with higher progressivity. Second, richer countries have more progressive tax systems. Third, progressivity varies by family structure, with marriage and children associated with higher progressivity. Finally, transfers play an important role in redistribution, making the overall tax-and-transfer function more progressive than the tax function.",

We theoretically characterise optimal carbon and income taxes and quantify them for the US economy with a climate model calibrated to DICE. In contrast to the representative-agent setting, we find that (i) tax distortions have a negligible effect on the optimal carbon tax; (ii) inequality only slightly reduces it; (iii) the revenue from carbon taxes is optimally split about equally between reducing tax distortions and increasing transfers. Unlike the double-dividend policy, optimal carbon taxation has progressive welfare effects and low-income households benefit even in the short run.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the economic and political effects of carbon pricing across European regions. Our main finding is that a well-identified increase in carbon prices reduces emissions but entails economic and political costs: higher carbon prices significantly reduce output and employment while increasing vote shares for extremist and populist parties, contributing to political fragmentation. Consistent with an economic voting channel, opinion surveys reveal a more pessimistic economic outlook and declining environmental concerns among respondents. Importantly, the economic and political costs are not borne equally: carbon-intensive regions experience a larger decline in output and see a stronger shift to extremist political parties. Our findings highlight the need for complementary policies to mitigate the unequal economic impacts of carbon pricing and the associated political backlash.",

We compile an annual series of comparable nighttime lights globally from 1992 to 2023 by applying adjustments that consider key factors affecting accuracy and comparability over time: top coding, blooming, and variations in satellite systems (DMSP and VIIRS). Applied to various low-income settings, the adjusted luminosity series outperforms the unadjusted series as a predictor of local development, particularly over time and at higher spatial resolutions.",

          "authors": "Andrea Spehar",
          "abstract": "This article examines how labour migration is governed and politicised in Croatia, a post‐socialist EU member state undergoing a rapid transition from emigration to immigration. Drawing on policy analysis, party manifestos, and media sources, it traces Croatia's shift toward liberalised recruitment of third‐country nationals amidst labour shortages and demographic decline. At the same time, migration has become increasingly politicised, particularly during the 2024 national elections. The article introduces the concept of segmented migration governance to capture this dual logic: while policy frameworks have liberalised to meet market needs, institutional oversight remains weak, integration underdeveloped, and political narratives fragmented. Technocratic depoliticisation by the ruling centre‐right coexists with cultural threat narratives from far‐right actors, generating a stratified political field. By situating Croatia within broader debates on migration governance, populism, and post‐socialist transitions, the article highlights the need to better understand how labour migration regimes are shaped by institutional legacies, elite strategies, and regional political economies. The analysis concludes by recommending stronger oversight of recruitment agencies, enhanced labour protections, and more inclusive integration policies to ensure the long‐term sustainability and legitimacy of Croatia's migration model.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of work suggests that authoritarian regimes can enhance their external legitimacy by undertaking reform—from democratic or “pseudodemocratic” institutional changes at the domestic level to participation in international efforts to mitigate climate change. Yet the shared theoretical logic underlying this work has received surprisingly little empirical attention. This research contributes by offering findings from an iterative series of original survey experiments conducted over nationally representative samples of US citizens. Study 1 tested the foundational hypothesis—that reforms build external legitimacy—by adopting a simple independent groups design. Studies 2 and 3 subjected that hypothesis to harder tests via conjoint designs, and also evaluated extension hypotheses about when and in what sense “legitimacy” is gained. Across studies, the results consistently demonstrate that reforms (of a variety of types) do generate external legitimacy, offering both positive benefits as well as shielding benefits in keeping with theoretical arguments. The results also provide support for several new and previously undocumented findings concerning the role of reform type, type of legitimacy-derived gain, and the conditions under which such gains are more or less likely to accrue.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, nearly one hundred countries have adopted their first national cybersecurity strategies; however, the timing of these adoptions varies significantly. While a notable increase occurred after 2010, the catalysts behind this surge and the broader motivations driving countries to establish such strategies remain subjects of debate. Existing studies present conflicting arguments, drawing from diverse evidence and often focusing narrowly on specific countries or limited comparative analyses. This study addresses these debates by assembling the first comprehensive dataset, the National Cybersecurity Strategies (NCS) data, which covers the adoption of national cybersecurity strategies by 193 countries from 2000 to 2024. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of international-organization membership—and, to a lesser extent, military alliances and the cyber-threat environment—in driving adoptions. The NCS dataset not only equips researchers and policymakers with a valuable tool to study national cybersecurity strategies but also provides broader insights into the dynamics of policy diffusion across diverse issues, facilitating inquiry into broader international-relations questions.",

          "abstract": "In an increasingly interconnected world, prosociality across group boundaries becomes ever more important. Yet, a common premise in the behavioral and social sciences is that people are prosocial mainly toward their ingroup and not outgroups. So far, evidence for this premise comes mostly from studies in which people must choose between ingroup and outgroup prosociality, thereby precluding positive associations between the two types of prosociality. We study situations in which people make separate decisions regarding the ingroup and outgroup, allowing us to examine how ingroup and outgroup prosociality are related. Across six large-scale and cross-societal datasets spanning 743,402 individuals in 121 societies, we find a robust positive relationship between ingroup and outgroup prosociality. This relationship holds across societies, different group categorizations, and a diverse range of prosociality measures, including prisoner’s dilemmas, public good dilemmas, dictator games, and survey items on trust and tolerance. Although people are slightly more prosocial toward their ingroup than the outgroup, those who are prosocial toward the ingroup also tend to be prosocial toward the outgroup. The results offer an optimistic message for prosociality across group boundaries. When people are not made to choose between the ingroup and outgroup, they are generally prosocial toward both.",

          "authors": "José D. Anadón, Osvaldo E. Sala",
          "abstract": "Managed grazing is the most extensive land use on Earth. The prevailing narrative is that global rangelands, from grasslands to deserts, are being degraded by overgrazing due to overstocking. This perception arises from scientific literature, which contains an order of magnitude more studies on overstocking than on reductions in stocking rates. In contrast, over the past 25 y, regions representing almost half (42%) of global livestock have experienced reductions in stocking rates rather than the expected increases. We evaluated socioeconomic, technological, and climatic direct drivers, as well as indirect drivers, of global stocking patterns. Trade and climate had no detectable effects, whereas technological shifts and meat consumption had an impact on stocking rates. Direct drivers were largely controlled by human population and gross domestic product. Wealthier regions, with slower population growth, greater feed supplementation, and reliance on nongrazing livestock, reduced stocking rates. Less affluent regions, facing rapid population growth and rising meat demand but limited technological and feed resources, increased stocking rates. The overlooked reductions in stocking rates may have major ecological consequences at regional and global scales. Destocking can impact biodiversity, fire regimes, potentially increase carbon sequestration, and modify land–atmosphere fluxes. These effects are not simply the reverse of overstocking, as some consequences are irreversible, including state transitions and local extinctions. The skewed pattern of publications toward overstocking and overgrazing led to a perception of widespread degradation and had consequences on research direction and policy.",

For instance, projections about future flood risk inform where households choose to live, how lenders manage credit risks, and which communities receive federal funding. Yet data limitations and fundamental validation challenges raise important concerns about the reliability of such projections. The principles of transparency and reusability help address these concerns by enabling scrutiny of assumptions and methods, development of foundational data and tools, and consistent application of evaluation standards. While there is ongoing debate about how much transparency commercial climate risk services should provide, many expect noncommercial actors to lead the way on operationalizing transparency and reusability to fulfill their knowledge-building role in the climate risk ecosystem. However, despite prominent success stories, we find a substantial gap between principles and practice: Only four percent of the most-cited peer-reviewed climate risk studies in recent years fully share their data and code although this is a widely accepted minimum standard for transparency. We highlight low-cost measures that noncommercial researchers can take now to improve transparency and reusability. We also emphasize that transformative progress requires substantial investment, cross-sector collaboration, and careful consideration of tradeoffs, data rights, and multiple perspectives on equity. We hope this perspective accelerates both immediate actions and longer-term conversations to improve the ability of science to effectively support timely, evidence-based, and sound climate risk management.",

          "abstract": "Increasing environmental complexity and uncertainty have made organizational resilience a key concern in public administration. Yet its inherent ambiguity calls for a systematic examination of its conceptualizations, operationalizations, and applications. This meta‐narrative review synthesizes 49 studies, advancing the discourse by identifying three distinct narratives—maintenance, recovery, and adaptability—and exploring how they intersect when public institutions encounter acute shocks versus slow‐burn disturbances. Our analysis further identifies networking and collaboration as the most frequently studied antecedents of resilience, followed by digital technology and leadership. Resilience outcomes are also highlighted—continuous service delivery, enhanced public policy value, and strengthened institutional identity. A key epiphany emerges: Resilience is not merely about responding to crises but also about embedding strategic principles into long‐term governance—balancing top‐down authority with decentralized decision‐making to functionally and structurally address short‐term needs and long‐term transformation. We conclude by identifying implications for research, practice, and education.",

This approach aims to improve the user experience of respondents and the quality of their answers. To circumvent the tedious task of transcribing each audio recording for analysis, previous studies have used the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to convert audio data to text. Extending previous research, we benchmark the Google Cloud service with state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems from Meta (wav2vec 2.0), NVIDIA (NeMo), and OpenAI (Whisper). To do so, we use 100 randomly selected and recorded open-ended responses to popular social science survey questions. Additionally, we provide a basic, easy-to-understand introduction on how the Whisper ASR system works as well as code for implementation. By comparing Word Error Rates, we show that for our data the Google Cloud ASR service is outperformed by almost all other systems, highlighting the need to also consider other ASR systems.",

We assess these expectations in opinion dynamics around US Republicans’ views on COVID-19 vaccines. Data are from a preregistered experiment in a national survey of Republicans (n = 3,058). Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments or a control (no message) condition. Treated individuals received a message that connected vaccination to patriotism, a core conservative value, and this was attributed to a public health official (treatment 1), Republican voter (2), or Democratic voter (3). With the exception of those who were vaccinated and boosted, the message either had no effect or, more often, produced a backlash that led Republicans to express less favorable dispositions toward vaccination; backlash was stronger for messages sourced to a Democrat or public health official. Our conclusion discusses implications for moral reframing research and public health messaging.",

Using a multiverse analysis of 720 models, I observe how citizens’ ideological placement of the parties varied from 1990 to 2020 as a function of party ideologies at different levels: in Congress, in state legislatures, and in the electorate. Although public perceptions associate somewhat with elite ideology, more variation is attributable to how citizen-level partisans identify ideologically. This carries mixed implications. On one hand, partisan-ideological sorting in the electorate has made it easier for voters to see the difference between parties. On the other, it leads voters to see the parties as being more extreme than they would otherwise. These findings underscore the extent to which parties, beyond their governmental function, are social groups with norms that are fluid, identifiable, and politically impactful.",

          "authors": "Abu Siddique, Michael Vlassopoulos, Yves Zenou",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates whether virtual contact, initiated through a documentary film, can promote interethnic harmony. We carried out a cluster-randomized field experiment involving over 3,300 households across 121 multiethnic villages in Bangladesh. We find that a documentary film, designed to humanize the ethnic minority Santals and evoke empathy among the ethnic majority Bengalis, increased the ethnic majority’s prosociality toward minorities, though the strength of the evidence varies by treatment arm and outcome. Using emotion-detecting software to analyze facial expressions during the film viewing suggests that the documentary elicited emotional responses consistent with empathy. We do not find evidence that the intervention reduced the prevalence of negative stereotypes and discriminatory opinions toward minorities. In villages assigned to target network-central individuals, we find positive behavioral effects on untreated individuals, including Santals, and village-level administrative data suggest a reduction in police complaints in those villages. About five months after the intervention, we conducted a casual work field experiment involving 720 participants from the main intervention. In this task, pairs of ethnic majority and minority participants jointly produced paper bags for a local supplier under a piece-rate compensation scheme. We find positive treatment effects on productivity for both ethnic groups, with effects concentrated in villages where network-central individuals were treated. For the ethnic majority, increased prosociality, and for the ethnic minority, reciprocity or peer pressure may have contributed to increased productivity. Overall, our findings suggest that virtual contact and social networks may help promote harmony within multiethnic communities.",

We assemble a newly harmonized global dataset across eleven major opinion surveys, comprising 3.3 million respondents in 166 countries since 1990. Exploiting cohort-level variation, we find that individuals who experience higher GDP growth are more prone to trust their governments, with larger effects found in democracies. Higher growth experiences are also associated with improved perceptions of government performance and living standards. We find no similar channel between growth experience and interpersonal trust. Second, more recent growth experiences appear to matter most for trust in government, with no detectable effect of growth experienced during one’s formative years, closer to birth or before birth. Third, we find evidence of a “trust paradox” whereby average trust in government is lower in democracies than in autocracies. Our results are robust to a range of falsification exercises, robustness checks and single-country evidence using the American National Election Studies and the Swiss Household Panel.",

          "abstract": "We investigate mechanisms of institutional stability under profound environmental change, using corporate control in Japan as a critical case. Building on the concept of dualization in the comparative institutions literature, we theorize how dualized power relations at the top of the firm sustain insider control. Using data on executive board members of all non-financial firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 1993 to 2016, we show that “lifetimers”—employees who spend their entire careers with a single company—continue to enjoy substantial advantages in CEO succession. They maintain their dominance by promoting fellow lifetimers and constraining the prospects of other candidates. At the same time, “external appointees”—organizational outsiders who join the firm directly as executive board members—also benefit from their institutional ties and boundary-spanning roles. Yet, unlike lifetimers, their relative advantages are fragile, as they lack durable intra-firm power bases and are more exposed to shifting external conditions and internal politics. Our findings suggest that resistance by organizational insiders, combined with the selective co-optation of outsiders, can help preserve institutional arrangements in a changing environment.",

          "authors": "Lærke Høgenhaven, Louis Møgelmose, Hjalmar Bang Carlsen, Jonas Toubøl",
          "abstract": "This study contributes to the sociology of volunteering and crisis research by analyzing the little studied relationship between crisis volunteering (addressing societal crises) and ordinary volunteering (unrelated to crises). This is achieved by examining sector level resilience of ordinary volunteering during crises, possible spill-over between ordinary and crisis volunteering, and the persistence of individual crisis volunteers across the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2022 and the reception of Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia’s invasion in 2022. Using cross-sectional data from random samples of Danish adults before (n2020 = 3,519), during (n2021 = 1,700) and after (n2024 = 1,548) the pandemic, the results show that ordinary volunteering was highly resilient to the pandemic despite a significant reduction during the crisis. A five-round panel (n = 694) further shows that, while ordinary volunteering prior to the crisis correlated with crisis volunteering, crisis volunteering did not spill over into ordinary volunteering after the pandemic. Rather, crisis volunteers persisted engaging in crisis volunteering when Ukrainian refugees arrived. These findings have important implications for civil society studies because the absence of spill-over between ordinary and crisis volunteering suggests that the two types of volunteering operate according to distinct logics and the persistence of crisis volunteers across crisis challenges notions of crisis volunteering being spontaneous and emergent.",

          "authors": "Ryan P Thombs, Andrew K Jorgenson",
          "abstract": "A foundational question in environmental sociology is whether economic growth can be sufficiently decoupled from greenhouse gas emissions. Scholars working in different analytical perspectives assert that such a decoupling is largely contingent on more stringent climate policy that mandates or incentivizes the reduction of carbon-intensive production. However, there is limited research on whether policy has such a moderating influence. Here, we extend the literature by testing whether more stringent climate policy moderates the effect of economic growth on greenhouse gas emissions using panel data from 1990 to 2022 for forty-nine countries. Building on the extended two-way fixed effects estimator, we advance an approach for estimating country-specific and average short-run and long-run effects with dynamic models that we show outperform other macro panel estimators using Monte Carlo experiments. Using this approach, we find that, on average, strong climate policy stringency decouples economic growth from emissions in the short run and the long run and that the decoupling effect is largest in higher-income nations. However, we also find that greater policy stringency is associated with increases in emissions in lower-income and middle-income nations. We then build a hypothetical three-nation World that consists of a lower-income, middle-income, and higher-income nation and develop a suite of scenarios that differ based on their rate of economic growth and climate policy stringency. The results suggest that steady-state and degrowth scenarios offer the most sustainable futures in terms of lower emissions and that degrowth is the most equitable in terms of reducing emissions. We conclude by arguing that these findings have significant implications for policymaking and for key theoretical debates in sociology regarding economic growth and the environment.",

The authors suggest that relationships between youth workers and youth within CBES are essential catalysts for deepening youths’ understanding and navigating white space.",

While the state of nature account in social contract theory is generally invoked to justify the state's authority, I argue in this paper that no extant account succeeds in doing so. The primary reason, I argue, is that extant state of nature theories fail to capture an empirically plausible account of human life under stateless conditions. This failure undermines the justificatory force of these theories. Instead, I argue that extant state of nature accounts are best understood as attempts to justify morality or authority in general.",

Specifically, I aim to show how desert‐based reasons can help justify seemingly futile defensive efforts. Importantly, this justification does not stem from the idea that the victim of an attack may “draw against punishment” in seeking to avert a threat, but rather from the belief that culpable aggressors deserve to be resisted.",

          "abstract": "The well-established finding that migrants tend to be lonelier than their counterparts without a migration background in the country of settlement is typically ascribed to challenges that come with international migration. This study's point of departure is that migrants’ high levels of loneliness may, in part, also reflect what could be called a “lonely migrant effect,” that is, selection of lonely people into international migration. Selection of this kind was assessed using the 2012 and 2016 rounds of the Dutch Public Health Monitor (n = 685,088), enriched with administrative data on emigration in the three years following survey data collection. Overall, 2,401 respondents emigrated from the Netherlands in this period. Emigration was regressed on respondents’ baseline loneliness scores in logistic regression models adjusted for various potential confounders. Results indicate that people who were lonely, as indicated by a 3+ score on the De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale, were approximately 1.27 times as likely as their nonlonely peers to emigrate in the observed period. No significant differences were found between people who were moderately lonely and people who were severely lonely. These findings suggest that elevated loneliness among migrants may partly reflect preexisting loneliness and should be interpreted with this selection effect in mind.",

          "authors": "Dimitri M’Bama, William Tilleczek",
          "abstract": "Asceticism has a bad reputation in political and social theory—insofar as it has any reputation at all. If it is not ignored entirely, it tends to be aligned with either political elitism or political quietism. On the one hand, asceticism is often considered a special privilege of the aristocracy, which alone has the leisure to turn away from worldly affairs and cultivate the self as an aesthetic object, and thus to reproduce its dominant position in a social hierarchy that it has a strong interest in maintaining. On the other hand, theorists from Hegel to Arendt and beyond have dismissed asceticism and practices of self-transformation as a mere retreat from politics into the “inner citadel.” This article seeks to excavate and theorize a counter-tradition of political asceticism in order to demonstrate that practices of the self are not the property of the elite and indeed have been the conditions of possibility for anticolonial and anti-racist resistance struggles in highly diverse contexts. With comparative attention paid especially to MK Gandhi and Frederick Douglass, we argue that traditional dismissals of asceticism in political theory have missed (a) the extent to which the “inner citadel” is often the prime location for struggle left to the colonized; (b) how this inner citadel is weaponized in endeavors to train oneself into capacities of political agency; and (c) how this training-into-agency—which we call liberation asceticism —is not merely an individual but a truly collective practice.",

          "authors": "Timo Pankakoski",
          "abstract": "This article retells the German intellectual history of political pluralism from a novel perspective: that of the state as a clearing house. In regular business transactions, clearing houses settle debts and mediate between buyers and sellers, bearing risks on both parties’ behalf for a fee. In politics, the clearing house image describes political pluralism, interest groups, and the common good metaphorically—and, in Germany, pejoratively at first. The clearing house topos emerged in Carl Schmitt’s interwar criticism of pluralism, parliamentarianism, and the League of Nations. Alongside Otto Kirchheimer, particularly the post-1945 Schmittian antipluralists Werner Weber and Winfried Martini adopted the term to criticize the “occupation” of the state by private interests. However, the clearing house metaphor was also reappropriated by defenders of the republic like Dolf Sternberger, Ernst Friesenhahn, Horst Ehmke, Günter Dürig, Ernst Fraenkel, and Otto Stammer. In their creative reinterpretations, the state as a mediator between rival interests and viewpoints became a moderately positive image—one not only compatible with the common good but, in fact, serving it. The analysis reminds us that the economic framing of pluralistic interests by no means automatically excludes considerations of the common good. Correspondingly, “clearing house” gradually turned from a word of abuse into an affirmative metaphor with prodemocratic pluralistic implications, thus capturing, in a microcosmic fashion, much of Germany’s postwar democratization. This was a collective process, and the discursive continuities with prewar antipluralism highlight how pluralist democracy lives off the linguistic resources at its disposal, occasionally by creative reinterpretation",

          "abstract": "Research indicates that people often end their childbearing years with fewer children than they had expected in young adulthood. However, our understanding of the role of infertility in explaining this discrepancy remains limited. Using data from 10 low‐fertility countries included in the second round of the Generations and Gender Survey, this study examines the correspondence between ideal and actual family size among men and women, as well as the influence of infertility and socioeconomic factors on whether they achieved the number of children they considered ideal for themselves. The results show that up to half of men and women end their reproductive years wishing they had more children. Having experienced infertility stands out as a key predictor of this gap, increasing the likelihood of underachieving one's ideal family size by 17 percent and 26 percent among childless men and women, and by 12 percent and 19 percent among those with one child.",

          "abstract": "School enrollment has increased in many sub‐Saharan African countries over recent decades, alongside substantial socioeconomic and demographic transitions. However, gains in educational enrollment have not been equal, raising questions about the determinants of access to and variability in school enrollment. The living arrangements of children constitute one possible factor associated with this variability. We leverage 60 census samples, provided by IPUMS International, to analyze links between living arrangements and school enrollment for 24 African countries between 1976 and 2019, and explore how these associations have changed across countries and over time. The results suggest that school enrollment among children aged 7–14 increased in all countries, but variability in enrollment by children's living arrangement persists. Children living in households without both of their parents or without their mother face a disadvantage compared to those in households with both parents. Among recent samples, living in households with a mother only is associated with higher school enrollment in around two‐thirds of countries, even when controlling for individual and household characteristics. The persistent heterogeneity in children's school enrollment across households demands further attention to better understand the links between family and developmental processes, and to inform policies aiming to increase children's school enrollment.",

Such resistance materializes through three key mechanisms within polycentric arrangements: decentralized political discretion, bureaucratic autonomy, and institutional capacity. In conducting a critical event analysis of environmental politics in Brazil, we analyze the actions of the Brazilian Central Bank, the Supreme Court, and a consortium of Amazonian governors. Although these entities do not have specific environmental mandates, their varying degrees of discretion, autonomy, and capacity enabled them to resist antidemocratic measures targeting environmental policies while fragmenting authoritarian presidential power. By examining how the combination of these three elements influenced the levels of resistance to democratic backsliding in Brazil, our findings illuminate both the challenges and promises of polycentric governance systems in promoting democratic deliberation in policy‐making within democracies under threat.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge is central to policy sciences and for good policymaking. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI)—particularly large language models ( LLMs )—raises critical questions about their impact on how policymakers analyze data, design alternatives, predict outcomes, and implement solutions to address societal challenges. While much of the public policy literature highlights LLMs' potential to automate and transform policy cycles, less attention has been given to how LLMs reshape the epistemic foundations of public policy—namely, how knowledge is sourced, produced, and applied within policymaking and institutional systems—along with emergent epistemic risks. Building on Lasswell's functional and pragmatic view of the policy sciences and drawing upon concepts of LLMs as epistemic technologies, this article proposes a heuristic framework to articulate the epistemic impacts of LLMs on policymaking. Specifically, the framework explores how LLMs transform policy epistemics through first‐order effects—changes in knowledge production itself—and second‐order effects—shifts in power dynamics within policy networks. The article concludes by outlining a future research agenda to advance public policy scholarship in the age of AI.",

This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of the field's development by tracing its origins and transformations over time. We introduce a time‐based and multifaceted framework that delineates the evolution of policy studies in China into four distinct phases: germination (1978 to mid‐1990s), burgeoning (late 1990s to 2012), normalization (2013 to 2022), and transformation (2023 to present). We first analyze the evolution of each phase in terms of historical contexts, disciplinary development, policy research (including policy domains, theoretical advancements, and methodological approaches), and intellectual engagement with the international policy research community. Drawing on a self‐compiled database of 347 articles, we then present an overview of key trends across these four phases and further analyze the patterns of policy areas, theories of the policy process, and research methodologies for each phase. We conclude the article by identifying major challenges confronting policy studies in China and outlining potential opportunities for advancing the field.",

This article draws on insights from gender and policy studies and suggests that the NPF benefits from adopting a multifaceted notion of power that includes empowerment as well as domination. In so doing, the article also demonstrates the usefulness of the NPF for feminist scholars interested in unpacking the diversity of actors, strategies, and claims in gender equality policy processes. Empirically, the allocation of government grants as part of the Swedish national violence prevention program is used as a case of representation in the policy process, with funding applications providing a novel source of narrative data. The analysis displays a moderate level of diversity among the represented groups—although with a strong emphasis on children and youth as the victims or at‐risk communities. The article also demonstrates how the reconstruction of narratives—by connecting characters, plots, and policy solutions—displays a (lack of) diversity in narratives told about different groups of victims.",

The key mechanisms underlying the PET, i.e., policy image and venue, information processing, and institutional friction, are complemented with insights from implementation research to investigate positive and negative feedback during policy implementation—and thus punctuation at this stage of a policy change process. I label this concept as implementation punctuation. A mixed‐method approach is applied to investigate the policy change dynamics of the Swiss Child and Adult Protection Policy over 17 years. Findings indicate that the PET key mechanisms play an equally important role in shaping an implementation punctuation as they do in the preceding phases. Changes in venues and the policy image that attracted attention led to the creation of a positive feedback loop during the implementation of the case studied, which prevented the new policy from reaching equilibrium. Thus, the concept offers a way to analyze a prolonged period of instability after policy adoption. Investigating PET key mechanisms during implementation helps policy scholars to understand the course and duration of a policy punctuation.",

          "abstract": "What prompts citizens to stay or leave when political conditions deteriorate in their homeland? Traditional theories suggest that loyalty to one's homeland encourages individuals to stay rather than emigrate. Yet, there is limited empirical research examining how specific forms of loyalty influence emigration decision-making. This article analyzes loyalty through a relational lens, focusing on the ideological distance citizens perceive between themselves and others in their political community, rather than their degree of attachment to an identity or political entity. We use the concept of relational loyalty and argue that it plays a role in shaping citizens’ emigration decision-making. Drawing on a survey of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, we find that individuals who perceive themselves as more committed to liberal democratic values than the average citizen are more likely to have formulated concrete emigration plans. However, this perceived value disparity has limited predictive power in determining mere emigration intentions or actual emigration. These results demonstrate that while divergences in political values can influence politically-motivated emigration, their impact varies across different stages of the emigration decision-making process. Our study contributes to the widely used exit-voice framework and deepens our understanding of emigration dynamics among pro-democracy constituencies within authoritarian contexts.",

          "abstract": "Research on the integration of refugees in the United States has uniquely focused on the experience of persons resettled with the refugee label. Yet many, if not most, refugees resettled in the United States have been ordinary migrants, persons whose departure from home was discretionary not compelled, but to whom the refugee label was affixed for political reasons. By contrast, the same body of research has ignored the experience of persons who exited home because of compulsion but arrived in the United States as self-settlers, a population consisting of persons granted asylum (the legal equivalent of refugee) and the still larger number of de facto refugees, whose quest for asylum has been denied. Correcting this deficiency, this paper contrasts the experiences of Vietnamese and Salvadoran immigrants to the United States, populations that fled violence, arrived simultaneously in the United States in large numbers, and have since grown in parallel fashion. Although most Vietnamese and Salvadorans arrived after passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, which defined eligibility for refugee recognition in universalist terms, the United States only granted de jure recognition to Vietnamese, denying legal protection to de facto refugees from El Salvador. This paper analyzes the history behind that decision, shows how it affected subsequent immigration and naturalization patterns, and considers long-term impacts on integration.",

          "abstract": "Migration is increasingly recognized as a dynamic, often recurrent, and intergenerational process. Yet, little research has examined how childhood exposure to international migration, through one's own moves and through family history, shapes aspirations for future (im)mobility. In this article, we address this gap using a life course perspective to investigate how both direct and indirect migration experiences during childhood influence openness to international migration in adulthood. We distinguish between immobility, return migration, and onward migration aspirations, and explore underlying mechanisms such as socioeconomic status, transnational ties, multilingualism, experiences of discrimination, and identification with the country of residence. Using data from the French survey Trajectoires et Origines 2 , we find that individuals with a more recent immigrant descent tend to express higher return migration aspirations but lower onward migration aspirations. Direct migration experiences in childhood are associated with greater openness toward migration overall, though differently by descent: among those with a distant immigrant background, childhood migration fosters openness to onward migration, while it increases return aspirations among those with a more recent immigrant descent. These results offer new insight into how migration and immobility aspirations are shaped early life experiences and family migration histories.",

          "abstract": "Amidst young adults’ increasing labour market insecurity and rates of parental co-residence, this article examines how unemployment and underexplored forms of non-standard employment (NSE)—underemployment and temporary and agency work (TAW)—are associated with inter-generational co-residence in the United Kingdom. Refining the feathered nest/gilded cage hypothesis to incorporate forms of non-NSE, we analyse how parental social class moderates this relationship across the transition to adulthood phase, driven by both protective and propellant motives. We estimate logistic regression models using the 2021–2024 waves of the UK Labour Force Survey, which allow for a precise identification of time-related underemployment and agency working. Results suggest that states of labour underutilization (underemployment) and impermanence (TAW) as well as unemployment are all associated with higher probabilities of parental co-residence relative to standard employment. This relationship is in part mediated by earnings disparities. Further, socio-economic background matters—the positive insecurity co-residence association is most pronounced amongst young adults from service-class backgrounds. This is consistent with a refined feathered nest/gilded cage hypothesis whereby higher parental resources facilitate co-residence at earlier phases of adulthood transitions, especially for young adults facing labour market insecurities, but this slightly tapers off with age.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the implications for gender equality of the increasing prevalence of heterosexual couples in which the woman is more highly educated than the man (‘educational hypogamy’). It provides a structured overview of competing theoretical predictions regarding the association of hypogamy with gender equality within couples and formulates specific hypotheses that address selection into hypogamous unions. Using data from the Generations and Gender Survey and employing diagonal reference models, the study investigates how hypogamy relates to gender attitudes and the gender division of labour within couples, net of partners’ educational attainment levels. Results indicate that hypogamy is associated with a more egalitarian division of paid work, particularly among parents, and with fathers expressing more supportive attitudes towards maternal employment. However, although hypogamous women are more strongly engaged in the labour market after becoming mothers than their counterparts in homogamous unions, their partners’ contributions to household chores do not increase proportionately, reflecting a pattern consistent with the ‘stalled gender revolution’ theory. Thus, hypogamy is associated with more gender equality in labour market participation but not with a more equitable sharing of household tasks.",

Despite these incentives, many do pay, and research suggests that non-monetary mechanisms are important drivers. Here, we focus on social norms and propose that they drive tax paying and mediate the relationship between institutional quality and tax payments, potentially leading to either virtuous or vicious feedback cycles. Using two studies conducted in Italy, a nationally representative survey and vignette experiment (NStudy I = 1,218) and an online behavioural experiment (NStudy II = 448), we show that: (i) social norms and perceptions of institutional quality predict tax payments; (ii) social norms affect tax payment intentions and behaviour; and (iii) institutional context influences these dynamics either positively or negatively through social norms. Our results highlight the essential role of social norms in shaping tax payments and their link to context-specific institutional factors.",

          "authors": "Maria Nordbrandt, Gina Gustavsson, Karen N. Breidahl",
          "abstract": "It is often suggested that one way to reduce affective polarization is to remind citizens of a common in-group identity – such as the national one – to bridge partisan divides. Yet, to our knowledge, such a causal link has only been found in the United States, and even there, it has not been tested by exposure to the most common national symbol: the flag. Thus, we still do not know if such implicit yet ubiquitous reminders of national identity, rather than those that explicitly invoke national pride, are able to reduce affective polarization. In order to fill this research gap, we conducted a survey experiment in Sweden and Denmark in 2023/2024, two countries where national flags are omnipresent yet often ‘unwaved’. Using two versions of subtle flag treatments, our results show that in Sweden, subjects who were primed with a picture of the national flag showed lower levels of affective polarization measured as social distancing, but not in terms of trait stereotyping or party dislike. This effect was not mediated, however, by the strengthening of explicit national identity attitudes, such as national pride. These results suggest that flags need indeed not be explicitly waved in order to work their unifying magic.",

          "authors": "Martin Elff, Ruth Dassonneville, Kamil Marcinkiewicz",
          "abstract": "Religion has long been considered an important determinant of voting behaviour. However, the secularisation of Western societies has changed its role. Secularisation not only limits the political relevance of religion, it may also affect the nature of religious cleavages themselves. While extant literature suggests that differences between religious denominations are in decline, with regard to differences between religious and non-religious voters there are two divergent expectations, (1) that these differences are also in decline and (2) that there is an increased polarisation between the religious and the non-religious. For the latter expectation, evidence has already been found regarding the United States. In this paper, we examine whether a similar change can be observed in Western Europe. Combining data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and information on parties’ positions from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), we assess the nature of over-time changes in the connection between religion and the vote choice. The results point to an increased polarisation between members of a Christian church and the non-religious, however, we also find that non-Christians are more similar to the non-religious than to Christians. We also uncover a growing division between Catholics and Protestants that does not fit common expectations. These findings challenge earlier work on the political consequences of secularisation and lead to new research questions.",

          "abstract": "Recently, sociology saw a surge of interest in practical theorizing. Many contributions to this discourse adopt an empiricist approach to theory building characterized by data centrism, a separation between discovery and justification, and an unclear or restricted role of existing theory. The article develops “hermeneutic theorizing” as a distinct approach that reconceptualizes engagement with prior theory as a central driver of novel theorizing. This hermeneutic mode has implicitly shaped the self-understanding of many classical sociological theorists and finds its roots in Hegel’s concept of determinate negation and the broader hermeneutic tradition. By explicating this way of thinking with and against tradition and showing its relevance for contemporary sociological theory building, the article aims to broaden the conception of theorizing and find a systematic place for the critical engagement with established theory in theory development.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines refugee hubs that attract heightened scrutiny and opportunities for integration. Focusing on Turkey, we argue these hubs offer a sense of protection and expose refugees to increased control by authorities. Thus, we introduce the concept of collective hypervisibility to analyse how Syrian refugees in two Turkish hubs articulate and perceive their lived experiences through both positive and negative perspectives as a group. Refugees often view these neighbourhoods as shields from typical integration challenges faced by newcomers. However, living in such spaces also renders them targets, as all refugees are perceived as a homogeneous group, ignoring individual differences. By exploring refugee perceptions, we reveal shared dynamics across refugee hubs and offer insights relevant to similar contexts globally.",

The research is based on several interviews with 19 Burundian refugees who fled Burundi sometime between 2014 and 2022 and were living in Belgium or Sweden at the time of the interviews. My interlocutors attempted to wait out the period when they were in danger and used various strategies to ensure their security during this wait. This waiting period prior to leaving the home country had some different characteristics to waiting after fleeing. This waiting was an attempt to hold on to a near past, a past of living securely in Burundi, rather than an attempt to access a new future, which is often the case in other waiting scenarios in migration.",

          "abstract": "This article explores how the UNHCR exercises productive power through gendered knowledge in migration governance. Using multimodal semiotic analysis of twelve animated films from the Telling the Real Story campaign, we examine how public information campaigns (PICs) on irregular migration risks balance humanitarian protection and border control through gendered depictions. While PIC research is expanding, it often overlooks the role played by gender in the campaigns’ content. Our analysis shows that TRS’s animated films legitimize and reward female migrants’ agency only when aligned with UNHCR’s institutional goals, while pathologizing male mobility by consistently framing it as a threat or failure. These representations emerge across four themes: family (entrepreneurs vs caregivers), violence (aggressors vs victims), professional aspirations (money vs education) and autonomy (independent vs dependent). We argue that such discourse reinforces gender essentialisms, mainly through different renderings of migrant agency, legitimizing both humanitarian and securitizing migration governance while potentially undermining migrant empowerment.",

Drawing on fieldwork data, it demonstrates how returnees sustain translocal connections through networks, commuting patterns, and socio-economic practices. By introducing the notion of partial return, this paper advances a critical framework for examining the dialectical tension between mobility and emplacement among internally displaced people who decided to return. Empirically, the study distinguishes between nominal and de facto modes of partial returns, highlighting how they arise as adaptive responses to the gap between international return policies specified in the Dayton Peace Agreement and intricate post-war realities. By situating partial returns as pragmatic responses to the difficulties, uncertainties, and insecurities shaping post-war environments and everyday local contexts, this study contributes to debates concerning migration, displacement, and transnational studies.",

The thesis explored the interplay between EU migration management measures and the lived experiences of refugees, focusing on the Greek island of Lesvos as a critical site of bordering and refugee resistance. Drawing on three case studies conducted between 2021 and 2023, the research examined how physical, legal, and social borders shape refugee access to EU territory, protection, and integration in Europe. Through interviews with representatives of two civil society organizations in Lesvos, refugee-produced artwork and social media content, the study also highlighted the political agency of refugees as they navigated and resisted restrictive measures. Refugee-created visual artifacts, such as paintings and photographs, serve as powerful tools for self-expression and advocacy, challenging dominant narratives of victimhood, invasion, and threat. The findings underscore the need to reimagine migration governance, centering refugee voices and prioritizing protection over deterrence. This Reflection contributes to broader discussions on refugee rights, border politics, and the human dimensions of migration management.",

This study examines the multidimensional reproductive injustices experienced in New Kuchigoro camp, Abuja, and Malkohi camp, Yola, using in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 36 internally displaced women, selected through purposive sampling. Grounded in the reproductive justice theory and informed by intersectional feminism and structural violence, the research integrates doctrinal analysis with phenomenological inquiry. Findings reveal systemic barriers to reproductive autonomy, including coerced reproductive decisions, pervasive gender-based violence, and limited access to essential SRHR services. These injustices are compounded by entrenched socioeconomic inequalities, patriarchal power structures, and gaps in international and domestic legal protections for SRHR in displacement settings. The study underscores the urgency of gender-responsive healthcare interventions, economic empowerment initiatives, and robust accountability mechanisms to dismantle structural inequities and safeguard the reproductive rights of displaced women in Nigeria.",

This study investigates whether public denials by politicians accused of corruption influence electoral accountability and how positive and negative partisanship shape voter reactions. Using a 2019 online survey experiment conducted in Brazil, we find that denials significantly improve the accused politician's public image and electoral prospects, particularly among partisan respondents. Notably, negative partisans are especially responsive to these defense strategies. These findings shed light on the significant role political elites play in shaping public reactions to corruption, offering new insights into the dynamics of electoral accountability and democratic governance.",

          "abstract": "Prioritization between societal issues is a necessary component of political decision‐making at the helm of governance. The attention‐based view explains how performance below aspirations directs political attention to a singular policy domain, but leaves unaddressed how politicians prioritize between multiple performance shortfalls across policy domains. This article provides a framework and an experimental test of situated attention that explains how politicians prioritize between simultaneous societal issues across different policy domains. Our framework outlines how politicians rely on issue characteristics concerning importance (salient vs. non‐salient), problem‐definition (‘hard’ vs. ‘easy’), solution (i‐framed vs. s‐framed) and temporal scope (short‐term vs. long‐term). A discrete choice experiment utilizing a probability sample of 964 elected politicians is conducted to provide an empirical test, revealing that politicians are more likely to prioritize policy issues that are salient, ‘easy’, s‐framed and short‐term, as well as robustness of these effects across variation in political ideology. We conclude by discussing implications for an attention‐based understanding of political decision‐making in contemporary governance.",

We reanalyze and replicate a survey experiment studying the effect of acquiescence bias on estimates of conspiratorial beliefs and political misinformation. Correcting a minor data coding error yields a puzzling result: respondents with a postgraduate education appear to be the most prone to acquiescence bias. We conduct two preregistered replication studies to better understand this finding. In our first replication, conducted using the same survey platform as the original study, we find a nearly identical set of results. But in our second replication, conducted with a larger and higher-quality survey panel, this apparent effect disappears. We conclude that the observed relationship was an artifact of inattentive and fraudulent responses in the original survey panel, and that attention checks alone do not fully resolve the problem. This demonstrates how “survey trolls” and inattentive respondents on low-quality survey platforms can generate spurious and theoretically confusing results.",

          "abstract": "How do insights from environmental politics of the 1970s–1990s inform our understanding of contemporary climate governance? I suggest that the governance response for addressing pollution problems of the 1970s–1990s was sequential. The first wave of governance interventions addressed market failures; the second wave targeted government failures. In contrast, climate governance seeks to correct both market and government failures simultaneously. Furthermore, unlike first-generation environmental problems, domestic and international factors together hinder progress on climate change. Theoretically, this article examines how governance failures are recognized and addressed, how and why backlashes arise, and which governance innovations are possible in contested policy spaces. Three lessons emerge. First, governance innovations should be sculpted with failure drivers in mind. Because political challenges stall climate progress, climate policy must address these political concerns. Second, governance innovations cannot be expected to deliver a perfect solution devised by a technocratic elite. Policy progress is uneven, slow, and incremental. Third, governance arrangements, even on arguably highly technocratic issues, require social and political licenses to operate. Instead of asking the public to “listen to science,” climate-policy advocates should listen to people and devise policies that the public views as improving their everyday lives.",

          "authors": "Oscar Nowlan",
          "abstract": "This paper examines blame shifting, where elected officials attempt to deflect blame for negative outcomes onto other actors. While prior research suggests that citizens generally disapprove of this tactic, this study re-evaluates how contextual factors shape these reactions, focusing specifically on cases of public service failure. In many areas of public management, service delivery is delegated or contracted out to public or private organizations, raising the question of whether such institutional arrangements make it easier for politicians to shift blame onto these agents. A survey experiment (n = 955) was conducted in the United Kingdom involving a hypothetical public service failure. Information cues varied the response strategy of local elected officials (shifting blame or accepting responsibility) and the service delivery model (public or private sector; high or low delegation). The results from OLS regression analyses show that participants were generally less approving of blame shifting compared to accepting responsibility. However, approval increased when the organization being blamed was viewed by participants as carrying more blame for failures in service delivery than the official. Although delegation levels did not directly moderate the effect of blame shifting, further logistic regression analysis shows that higher delegation made participants more likely to view the service provider as culpable, which in turn influenced how they reacted to blame shifting tactics. These findings highlight the conditional nature of public reactions to blame avoidance behavior, showing that citizens’ evaluations of tactics like blame shifting depend on their beliefs about who is responsible, which can be shaped by institutional context. The study offers new insights into when blame shifting may appear more credible or justified and underscores the role of context in shaping the effectiveness of political blame avoidance strategies.",

          "abstract": "How do public agencies manage diverse programs under limited budgets? Resource constraints force agencies to prioritize tasks, requiring strategic decisions about how to allocate resources effectively. In this paper, I develop a gametheoretical model that explores how agencies shape and restructure their task portfolios under budgetary constraints. In response to budget reductions, I argue that agencies reallocate resources by prioritizing more efficient tasks for improved performance, within their portfolios. To test my theoretical claims, I analyze an original dataset of antitrust cases filed by the U.S. Antitrust Division (AD) from 1970 to 2019. Using compositional analysis, I find systematic associations between budgetary changes and the AD’s litigation portfolios. Specifically, budget cuts are associated with a higher share of antitrust criminal cases—the most efficient type for improving performance metrics—and with relatively lower shares for other case types. This study offers new insight into how public agencies navigate budgetary constraints to achieve their public missions while meeting performance expectations.",

          "abstract": "Why do Supreme Court justices break away from the norm of respectful dissent? I answer this question by defining what constitutes a respectful dissent in the context of the Supreme Court, illustrating why the practice is a norm, and describing how the norm became established. I then explain why justices might decline to pen a respectful dissent. I theorize that justices deviate from this norm to signal their intense displeasure with a ruling in a way that is more salient for non-legal audiences. I expect that dissent-majority ideological distance, the overturning of precedent, and specific areas of law increase the likelihood of non-respectful dissents. I test these hypotheses using a dataset composed of every dissenting opinion from 1957, the term with the first recorded example of the norm, to 2022, finding support for my theory. Interestingly, including time within the model further highlights the norm’s entrenchment in the Court and the unwillingness to break it. These findings emphasize the strategic nature of breaking the norm while also showcasing that collegiality is still present in dissenting opinions.",

Building on the updated PolDem dataset, which tracks media coverage of national election campaigns across fifteen European countries from 1972 to 2023, the symposium investigates how issue salience, party positioning, and voter behaviour interact under turbulent conditions. The introduction situates the contributions around three core themes: (1) measuring and comparing party communication across media and manifestos; (2) mapping cross-national and longitudinal variation in political conflict lines; and (3) identifying the drivers of politicization across economic, cultural, and political dimensions. Together, the articles offer an integrated, content-based perspective on campaign dynamics that links short-term issue emphasis to long-term party-system structuration. The collection advances our understanding of how crises reshape electoral competition and democratic representation in Europe.",

          "abstract": "The outbreak of war in Ukraine 6 weeks before the 2022 French presidential election generated an exogenous geopolitical shock that disrupted the electoral campaign. This study investigates how candidates adapted their issue emphasis strategies in response to this crisis and whether their adjustments aligned with voter issue salience. Using a combination of media content analysis (PolDem dataset) and public opinion survey data (Enquête Electorale Française – EnEF), the study systematically examines issue emphasis for the six major candidates. The findings show that while candidates initially engaged with the Ukraine crisis, their emphasis on the issue declined over time, as economic concerns dominated the campaign agenda. The analyses confirm that mainstream candidates followed public issue salience more closely than challenger candidates, who engaged in selective issue emphasis strategies. Notably, Marine Le Pen, often classified as a challenger, behaved as a mainstream candidate, prioritizing economic issues over her traditionally owned themes such as immigration. These findings contribute to broader debates on issue salience, electoral shocks, and strategic campaign behavior, demonstrating that while external crises can momentarily disrupt campaign agendas, they do not necessarily redefine electoral competition.",

To check for possible time-variation in the impulse responses, we propose Wald tests for two situations: (1) homoskedastic and (2) heteroskedastic structural shocks with changes in the unconditional variances. For the latter case, the challenge is to ensure that the test does not indicate time-varying impulse responses if the changes are due only to changes in the variances of the shocks. To illustrate the usefulness of the tests, they are applied to an empirical model of the crude oil market. They support time-varying shock transmission reflected in impulse response functions that change over time.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the interplay between crisis definition and governmental legitimacy. It proposes a constructivist framework that conceptualizes crisis as a political trial of delegitimization and re-legitimation. Challenging the conventional dichotomy between crisis definition and crisis management, the article argues that crises inherently involve discursive and political acts through which governments experience and respond to delegitimization. Drawing on the sociology of trials (épreuves) and discourse analysis, it identifies three distinct forms of crisis government—governing during crisis, governing the crisis, and governing by crisis—and examines their emergence through an empirical analysis of the French government’s management of the subprime crisis (2007–2009). Each mode corresponds to a specific form of delegitimization trials: epistemic, policymaking, or political, and to a distinct strategy of re-legitimation. By analyzing three key events, the study reveals how policymakers discursively redefine crises to legitimize various governmental strategies, ranging from inaction and targeted emergency interventions to long-term structural reform. Ultimately, the article highlights the role of crises as political junctures where governments negotiate legitimacy, redefine policy frameworks, and transform systemic vulnerabilities into opportunities for political and legitimacy renewal.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the persistence and transformation of Andrew Tate’s presence on YouTube following the removal of his official channels in August 2022. Combining two empirical approaches—a small-scale analysis of top-ranked videos from YouTube search results in 2022 and 2024, and a large-scale data set of over 112k videos—we examine how Tate-related content continues to circulate and how the platform moderates such material. Our findings show that Tate remains highly visible through a diffuse and decentralized network of actors who repackage his messaging into interviews, remixes, and YouTube-native formats. This configuration produces what we term the “Tate-space”: an ambient ideological environment where motivational rhetoric, aspirational masculinity, and far-right talking points converge. We find that YouTube’s substantial moderation efforts are outpaced by the speed and scale of recommendation-driven circulation and that deplatforming, while symbolically significant, fails to disrupt the cultural and logistical dynamics that sustain Tate’s influence.",

Through a comparative, cross-platform multimodal critical discourse analysis (MCDA) of SD’s posts on Facebook, X and TikTok, this article explores the differences in campaign content across platforms, and analyses how these differences provide insights into the party’s understanding of its audiences and the platforms’ respective functionalities. The analysis shows how SD leveraged platform functionalities to balance textual and visual features, repost content, and incorporate hyperlinks on Facebook and X. Using these features, the party posted text-laden, argumentative and seemingly informative posts, which are likely to appeal not only to the customary format of content on the platforms but also to its respective audiences. Yet, although SD had larger followings and much more well-established accounts on both Facebook and X, the party posted the majority of its campaign material on TikTok, primarily in the form of memes. These memes tended to include securitising clips of non-white men engaging in violent protests, vandalism and violence directed towards the local community and law enforcement. We discuss the role these memes play in the SD election campaign and the potential implications such content might have.",

This article offers a different perspective by examining how the platform and state co-evolve within contexts of institutional informality. Drawing on an in-depth case study of RoadMap, a digital freight platform in China, it theorizes situational co-evolution—a contingent, interest-aligned collaboration through which state capacity and corporate power are mutually reinforced. Three mechanisms drive this process: (1) the alignment of interests around solving governance challenges; (2) constructive regulatory entrepreneurship, whereby the firm enhances state regulation while expanding its own influence; and (3) the mutual reinforcement of infrastructural power, as digital infrastructures serve as instruments of both governance and accumulation. By shifting focus to an emerging-market context, this study reveals how digitalization in the Global South reconfigures the boundaries between market innovation and state governance, enriching the comparative understanding of platform capitalism.",

          "abstract": "This ethnographic investigation of international art fairs (IAFs) uncovers a logic of participation that extends theory on cultural markets and platforms. In addition to a logic of participation based on opportunity (for increasing sales), gallerists are driven by a logic of necessity to participate in prominent “curatorial” IAFs even though the fairs are organized and attended by autonomous market agents who have many options for accessing the art market (i.e., there are multi-homing opportunities). The underlying principle is that a player in a field will be motivated to participate in a platform insofar as the platform induces a strong “fear of not being recognized” (FNBR) by key audiences—in particular, other members in the upper status tier of a restricted field. This FNBR principle explains our article’s puzzle, providing clarity on the role of such logics of necessity that can be observed at play across social, cultural, and economic domains.",

          "abstract": "As recreational marijuana laws (RML) expanded marijuana access over the last decade, very little is known about the impact of RML on two costly social behaviors that may arise as a consequence of marijuana consumption: unhealthy eating (i.e., munchies) and sedentary lifestyle (i.e., couch‐lock). Using NielsenIQ Consumer Panel data, we find that the passage of RML led to an increase in the number of grocery store trips that involved “junk food,” as well as the amount of spending. This effect is particularly driven by an increase in ice cream, chips, and candy. Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), we find that the passage of RML also led to a decrease in exercise, particularly driven by a reduction in cardio, and suggestive evidence of more time spent at home. These results suggest that RMLs have an adverse effect on health through unhealthy eating and reduced physical activity, posing a significant public health challenge to diet‐ and lifestyle‐related chronic conditions.",

          "abstract": "Recruiting teachers via “grow‐your‐own” (GYO) programs is a popular, yet rarely evaluated, strategy for addressing local workforce shortages and ensuring that incoming teachers resemble, understand, and have strong connections to their communities. We provide novel evidence on the impacts of one such GYO program by exploiting the staggered rollout of the Teacher Academy of Maryland (TAM) Career and Technical Education (CTE) program across public high schools. Exposed students were more likely to become teachers a decade later by 0.6 percentage points (pp), or 45%. Effects were concentrated among White girls (1.4pp/39%) and Black girls (0.7pp/82%), though boys benefitted too (0.2pp/59%). Although White girls induced by the program to become teachers often did so in the same district they attended as students (0.9pp/43%)—a key goal of GYO and localized teacher recruitment programs—this was less common for Black girls. Rather, Black girls induced by the program to become teachers did so in districts with more Black teachers than their home district (0.4pp/143%) and in districts with higher starting salaries (0.5pp/239%). Access to the program also increased wages (5% on average/18% for Black girls), challenging the narrative that such programs cause students to forego more lucrative professions.",

          "abstract": "Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are operating in a challenging environment as governments are shrinking civic space and there is increasing competition for funding. Scholars have begun to examine how NGOs are adapting to these external challenges, but IR scholars have not yet systematically studied variation in their legal status and funding models. This article draws on scholarship from the NGO, not-for-profit, and political science literature, as well as publicly available datasets of NGOs’ legal status and finances. It identifies differences in legal form and funding models across large, well-established international NGOs. NGOs are often registering with multiple legal types, which enables them to adapt to shrinking civic space and engage in partisan politics. In addition, NGOs have different funding models; some rely on member donations, while others rely on large grants from philanthropic donors and/or the government. These funding models lead to different accountability dilemmas: member capture and donor capture. If IR scholars were to examine in detail the legal forms and funding models of NGOs, it would enrich our existing theories of resource competition, accountability, population ecology and shrinking civic space. It would also open new, exciting research agendas into the relationship between issue-based advocacy and partisan politics.",

          "abstract": "As America’s racial composition shifts, states that minimize changes to existing districts in successive redistricting cycles can entrench racial disparities in representation, a process I term dilutive drift. Using novel spatial measures of US House district change between successive congresses, I show that packing and cracking can occur passively, and not only through deliberate gerrymandering. States with long histories of racial exclusion, such as Alabama and Louisiana, make persistently fewer changes to their districts than other states. Minimal-change redistricting, I argue, can entrench unequal representation just as effectively as overt gerrymandering.",

          "authors": "Salih Birinci, Yusuf Kızılkan",
          "abstract": "The COVID‐19 pandemic has had significant effects on demographic mobility, economic systems, environmental changes, and social structures. In this study, using internal migration data from 2008 to 2023, the structure of interregional migration flows and internal migration trends in Türkiye during the COVID‐19 pandemic were evaluated. The migration movements of the regions before and during the pandemic were analyzed using crude migration, migration effectiveness, and net migration methods to examine changes in interregional migration flows. In addition, the Bayesian ARIMA model was used to estimate short‐ and medium‐term transformations in internal migration flows following the pandemic. This method was used to project internal migration flows at the regional level up to 2035. The analyses revealed a general decrease in migration intensity across all regions during the pandemic period. Furthermore, migration intensified significantly from metropolitan areas to smaller settlements and rural areas during the pandemic. The forecast model developed in the study predicts a decline in net migration rates in regions such as Istanbul in the coming years. In contrast, regions such as the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Western Anatolia are expected to receive more migration in the future. The study concluded that although the migration pull factor of metropolitan cities will weaken, they will retain this characteristic. Conversely, regions that have consistently experienced negative migration from the past to the present will continue to exhibit this characteristic in the coming period. The study's findings indicate that the impact of the reverse migration pattern observed during the COVID‐19 pandemic on internal migration flows was short‐lived. In this regard, the study has the potential to contribute to the planning of migration management policies, particularly by providing forecasts of migration flows and internal migration burdens at the regional level in the short and medium term.",

          "authors": "Nilay Kılınç, Russell King",
          "abstract": "Turkish migration to Germany has been the largest‐scale labour migration in postwar Europe, yet scant attention has been paid to the return flow to Turkey, and even less to the second generation's ‘return’. This paper rectifies this oversight and focuses specifically on the role of place in shaping the post‐return experiences of the second generation relocating to their parents' homeland. Based on narrative interviews with 71 returnees, we find that different outcomes await those relocating to the megalopolis of Istanbul, the tourist hub of Antalya, and a range of provincial towns. Istanbul offers the widest spectrum of job opportunities, especially to those with higher‐level qualifications. Antalya is attractive to returnees with low qualifications who are easily able to find work in the tourist economy and enjoy an ‘alternative’ lifestyle. Those who move to the provincial locations in northern, central and eastern Turkey are following family migration networks but face more difficulties accessing the labour market and adapting to a more ‘traditional’ society. Return outcomes are influenced by the positionalities of returnees, where the interplay of gender, class and social location in specific places shapes diverse return experiences.",

          "authors": "Sabina Kubiciel‐Lodzińska, Arkadiusz Gardecki, Bogdan Ruszczak, Jolanta Maj",
          "abstract": "Poland has emerged as one of the primary destinations for Ukrainian refugees, with ~953,000 forced migrants from Ukraine residing in the country as of May 2024. This paper examines the differences in labour market integration between Ukrainian voluntary migrants and forced migrants in Poland, comparing their situations from 2022 to 2024. The analysis is based on three quantitative surveys conducted in 2022, 2023 and 2024. The article compares the situation of both groups of migrants in several aspects: labour market situation, job satisfaction, knowledge of spoken Polish and migrants' residence plans. Our research revealed that the differences between the two groups evolved throughout the study period. Among the surveyed group of Ukrainian refugees, the proportion of those entering employment has increased significantly, reaching 64% in 2024. In the same year, the employment rate among pre‐war migrants was higher, at 75.7%. The survey shows that the knowledge of the Polish language among refugees has improved over the analysed period. In the first edition of the survey, more than 20% of respondents did not speak Polish, whereas in 2024, this number had decreased to 3.2%. Our research contributes to human capital theory by emphasising that the realisation of migrants' potential—how effectively they utilise and develop their skills, education and experiences in their new country—depends not only on their qualifications but also nature of migration and shows the contrast between voluntary and forced migrants from the same country.",

          "authors": "F. Bilge Kahraman",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of work permit procedures and rules in Türkiye on the legal status of migrants. Drawing on the literature on critical migration studies, it argues that work permit procedures in Türkiye position migrants within a legal category that can be described as semi‐regular. In this study, semi‐regularity refers to the legal status of migrants who possess the right to reside legally (e.g., through a residence permit or temporary protection status) but participate in the labour market without a work permit. Migrants experience this semi‐regular status differently in the labour market depending on their country of origin. Furthermore, unlike irregular migrants, those with semi‐regular status have access to some services, but in contrast to fully regular migrants, their access to services remains only partial. Research to date has largely focused on migrants in the Global North and this study broadens the literature on migrants' legal status by providing an example from Türkiye, a country of the Global South.",

          "authors": "Chengxin Pan, Nahui Chen",
          "abstract": "A central concept in Global International Relations (IR) is ‘global’ or ‘globality,’ which has been commonly understood as the sum total of all geo-cultural parts of the world. This understanding underpins Global IR’s efforts to make IR more geo-epistemologically representative and inclusive, but it has been criticized for its essentialism trap and geo-epistemology. While many critics problematize Global IR’s conception of globality, few pay attention to an alternative form of existence of globality, namely, its embodiment within each of the ‘geo-cultural’ parts. This article aims to engage with this form of globality by drawing on the conceptual framework of quantum holography, which sees the whole as not just comprising its parts but also being encoded within them. The implications are that if global-local relationality is holographic in nature, globalizing IR should entail not only externally expanding IR’s geo-epistemological horizon but also discovering and appreciating the globality that always already exists within each locale. Thus, this approach may help us tackle the stubborn binary of global vs. local/national in the Global IR debate and mitigate its essentialism trap and geo-epistemology. To illustrate, we apply this framework to problematize ‘Chineseness’ in the Chinese School of IR theory.",

          "abstract": "The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of global climate variability, yet its long-term effect on life expectancy remains unclear. Here we quantify how ENSO persistently impedes mortality improvement, leading to considerable life expectancy and economic losses across high-income Pacific Rim countries. We estimate life expectancy losses of 0.5 years (monetary equivalent loss of US$2.6 trillion) for the 1982–1983 El Niño and 0.4 years (US$4.7 trillion) for the 1997–1998 event. Climate projections under moderate emissions pathways suggest a cumulative decline of 2.8 years in life expectancy by 2100, amounting to US$35 trillion losses, with most of the monetary burden falling on the middle-aged population. These findings reveal that intensifying ENSO variability poses an underrecognized and enduring threat to human health and socio-economic stability, underscoring the urgent need for targeted adaptation strategies to safeguard population well-being.",

          "abstract": "Early AI policymaking in the United States appeared bipartisan, but subsequent developments raise the question of whether AI policy will become more polarized over time. To examine how partisanship takes root around novel policy issues, we perform a mixed‐methods study, analyzing survey data from 129 state legislators in 44 states and performing four case studies featuring legislative debates over enacted AI regulation in Idaho, Colorado, and Illinois. We articulate four potential partisan triggers that shape the emergence of issue polarization: (1) competing problem definitions, (2) preferred policy tools, (3) stakeholder participation, and (4) issue placement in policy subsystems, and we introduce the concept of subsystem shopping. Flexibility and compromise in subnational AI policymaking were initially common due to uncertain issue ownership over diverse problem definitions, the presence of disrupted industries, and deference to nonpartisan expert voices, which enabled subsystem shopping towards less controversial policymaking. However, bipartisan windows narrowed as AI became anchored in party‐owned domains, lobbying became more coordinated, and “soft” areas of initial legislative consensus hardened into disputes over more robust policy tools. These developments offer insights into how nascent policy domains can initially sustain bipartisan cooperation, and why it may erode unless actors work to preserve it.",

Here we argue that symmetry is one such principle, and present a symmetry-based theory that predicts whether category systems for a given domain tend to include an even or an odd number of categories. We test the theory against cross-linguistic data previously compiled for a range of domains and find that deictic day-naming and tense-marking systems tend to have an odd number of categories, but that systems for domains including seasons, phases of the moon, kinship, and cardinal directions tend to have an even number of categories. Our results therefore provide evidence of the widespread influence of symmetry on categorization across languages and domains.",

Understanding whether governments’ pledges of resolve are backed by their citizens is crucial for the credibility of these commitments. Here we show, based on survey experiments with 10,011 respondents in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy, that these countries’ publics share a similar pattern of preferences. In all countries, citizens strongly endorse Ukraine’s sovereignty and self-determination while weighing human suffering and conflict escalation risk, but less so economic costs. However, within countries, attitudes are polarized: roughly one quarter of citizens with pro-Western orientations show firm resolve, whereas another quarter with anti-Western views remain largely indifferent to political outcomes for Ukraine. These divisions indicate that democratic party competition could constrain the unity and durability of Western resolve against autocratic aggression.",

          "authors": "Anthony Fowler",
          "abstract": "Scholars typically assume that congressional party leaders whip their members and influence their voting behavior, but little evidence convincingly separates the effects of party leaders from the selection of members into parties. I find that a switch from a relatively moderate to a relatively extreme party leader causes rank-and-file members to cast more extreme roll-call votes (and vice versa). I further find that party leaders even influence the members who did not support their leadership bid, and rank-and-file members are less likely to cast partisan votes when there is no party leader. This study also sheds light on a historically anomalous period of Republican moderation, and it helps to explain the increase in congressional polarization over the past 50 years.",

          "abstract": "How do partisan differences in mass behavior and attitudes vary across contexts? Using new individual-level panel data on the COVID-19 pandemic from 54,216 US adults between March 2020 and September 2021, we consider how partisan differences vary according to the personal costs and benefits of behaviors, their public symbolism, and elite-level policy choices. Employing various panel data estimators, including difference-in-differences, we evaluate how partisan gaps evolve across changes to the political and health contexts, including the national vaccine rollout, individual vaccination status, and within-state policy variation. We find partisan divides are substantial even in (ostensibly) apolitical domains, although they are tempered by higher net personal costs to actions, lower public symbolism, and elite policy choices that counter national party cues.",

          "abstract": "The estimation of voting blocs is an important statistical inquiry in political science. However, the scope of these analyses is usually restricted to roll call data where individual votes are directly observed. Here, we examine a Bayesian mixture model with Dirichlet-multinomial components to infer voting blocs within longitudinal referendum data. This model infers voting bloc mixture within municipalities using state-level data aggregated at the municipal level. As a case study, we analyze the vote totals of Maine referendum questions balloted from 2008 to 2019 for 423 municipalities. Using a birth–death Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to inference, we recover the posterior distribution on the number of voting blocs, the support for each question within each bloc, and the blocs’ mixture within each municipality. We find that these voting blocs are structured by geography and largely consistent across the study period. The model finds that blocs exhibit both spatial gradients and discontinuities in their structure. Examining the statistical fit of the model, we uncover a small number of questions that show inconsistency with the statewide bloc structure and note that the content of these questions relates to specific regions. We conclude with possible statistical extensions, connections to other statistical frameworks in political science, and detail possible locations for model applications.",

          "abstract": "Why do people spread false news online? Previous studies have linked affective polarization with misinformation sharing and belief. Contrary to these largely observational findings, however, we show that experimentally improving people’s feelings about opposing partisans (versus members of their own party) has no measurable effect on people’s intentions to share true news, false news, or the difference between them, known as discernment. By contrast, we find evidence that a reminder of accuracy can modestly improve truth discernment among people who report sharing political news. These results suggest the need for a reexamination of the role of affective polarization in the dissemination of misinformation online.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an explosion of research looking at the relationship between Big Five personality traits and political behavior. This boom has been driven by the development of brief inventories that can assess subjects’ traits in as few as ten questions. Despite these developments, subjects’ own propensity to complete the surveys may be driven by their personality traits. As a result, key findings in this literature may be plagued by selection bias. Using a new data collection effort, I show that subjects who are more Agreeable or Neurotic have systematically different propensities to complete surveys. This result in hand, I show how relationships between the Big Five and political behavior may change estimated relationships between the traits and behavior. These findings are a significant caution to scholars examining the Big Five and their effects on a variety of phenomena.",

We evaluate the effects of five distinct message frames—scientific, religious, moral, and two economic (efficiency and equity)—on support for climate change policy using a randomized experiment with over 2300 U.S. respondents. Moving beyond pairwise frame comparisons, we adopt a policy learning approach that identifies the most effective frame using cross-validated sample splitting, thereby avoiding selective inference. We find that the economic efficiency frame consistently yields the largest gains in policy support, outperforming both the control condition and all alternative frames, on average. While the effects of covariate conditional frame assignment were modest and not significantly different from assigning the best overall frame, we find consistent positive effects of the efficiency frame across partisan subgroups. Our findings offer methodological and substantive contributions: we highlight how policy-learning methods can be applied in experimental framing studies, and we offer specific evidence on the relative efficacy of alternative framing messages on support for several climate policies.",

          "abstract": "What explains the attitudes of diasporas toward their ancestral homeland? One answer suggests some pull toward the country of origin (“ancestral homeland”) based on a shared cultural identity. In contrast, another explanation looks at how host country (“contemporary homeland”) politics surrounding the “perpetual foreigners” can push the diaspora toward their ancestral homeland. In this paper, we recognize that the link between the diaspora and the ancestral homeland is malleable. Specifically, we focus on the linguistic link—which can vary both spatially and temporally. We argue that when individuals of the diaspora do not speak the ancestral homeland language with their family at home, the primordial ethnic bond is weakened, and thus, they are less positive toward their ancestral homeland. We test our argument by focusing on the ethnic Chinese diaspora globally. Using the Sinophone Borderlands Survey, we identify and test whether those who speak Standard Chinese at home are more pro-China than their coethnics who speak a non-Standard Chinese vernacular. The results highlight that while the ethnic Chinese diaspora is more positive toward China than the non-ethnic Chinese respondents, what matters is whether a, and if so, which, Chinese vernacular is spoken.",

          "abstract": "The transgression of planetary boundaries demands that societal and ethical limits to Nature’s availability for human use, impact, and consumption are set, particularly in cities. However, so far, we lack an understanding of how sustainability-aligned values can define such limits and how limits can be operationalized in practice. The objectives of this perspective paper are therefore twofold. First, based on partnership ethics and the sociological concept of Uncontrollability , we identify broad values that feed into the concept of human-nature partnerships that respect limits to making Nature controllable. Second, we translate these broad values into four guiding principles that support urban planning to operationalize human-nature partnerships. Planning for urban human-nature partnerships thereby enables cities to become regenerative, healthy, convivial, and compassionate. Our concept of urban human-nature partnerships provides a heuristic for amplifying Nature’s voice and underscores the importance of relational capacities that enable urban planning to respond attentively.",

While neighbourhood norms are often seen as a barrier to conservation gardening, little is known about individuals’ expectations regarding their neighbouring gardens. Based on a multifactorial vignette experiment and a neighbourhood choice question, our results reveal that existing norms constrain gardening much less than is assumed, leaving significant scope for activating the biodiversity potential of private gardens.",
