### Troubleshooting ###

Here are some steps to take when you don't receive a confirmation email. 

1. Check your spam folder: Sometimes confirmation emails are classified as spam. 

2. If you can't find it in spam, resend your email with a clear subject line (e.g., "Please subscribe me") and a brief message (e.g., "Hi, I'm trying to subscribe to this list but haven't received a confirmation email"). While emails are processed automatically, it might help to bypass any UCL spam filters.

3. Still no confirmation? If you've tried the above and still haven't received a confirmation, write to <a href="mailto:hello@paper-picnic.com">hello@paper-picnic.com</a>. The list administrator will then manually subscribe you.
